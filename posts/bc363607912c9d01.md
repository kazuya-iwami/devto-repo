### Building the Foundation: Southwest Gas's Migration to SAP RISE on AWS

 Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Pankaj Kumar. I lead an AWS practice for energy and a few other markets, and with me we have a very special client who keeps Las Vegas warm. Please welcome Laxman from Southwest Gas. Thank you, and Balakalyan. So today we're going to talk about a very different subject. I know there's a lot being talked about cool agentic AI applications and how it's being applied to business. What we're going to talk about is the readiness for agentic AI. We heard in the morning there is a lot of boring work that goes behind being ready, so we're going to talk a little bit on that. This is the agenda that we'll cover, so we'll start with the introduction to Southwest Gas.

[![Thumbnail 60](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/60.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=60)

Laxman, thank you, Pankaj. Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Las Vegas. We are Southwest Gas.  We are based out of Las Vegas, headquartered in Las Vegas, and we serve three states: Arizona, California, and Nevada. We serve around 2.3 million customers across three different states. From a customer experience perspective, we won five years in a row number one customer satisfaction from JD Power in the West Large Residential category, and also we won recently two SAP innovation awards for our digital transformation and SAP RISE and BTP innovations.

[![Thumbnail 110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=110)

 So I think a lot is being talked about how these agentic AI projects are failing. If you have read the MIT report, it says almost 95% of the organizations report seeing zero outcome. A lot of POCs are going on, but not a lot of production quality upgrades are happening. Gartner has said almost 40% of the agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027, so these are scary numbers. HFS Research says that the what and why is all done, it's about the how of AI which will define 2026.

[![Thumbnail 160](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/160.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=160)

Now let's step back  and think about why these people are forecasting such failures. We at IBM, through IBM's own research talking to multiple clients across geographies and across businesses, one of the key things that we note is that agentic AI demands a new operating model which is engineered from the bottom up. So if you look at that diagram where we talk about on the top, scalable, flexible, and secure hybrid cloud infrastructure is the key. And then you look at the left, which is around enterprise applications, ecosystem partner systems, and external data sources which need to be interconnected.

If you take one thing out of this session, remember interconnected workflows. So it needs to be, as we work, people and agents work in harmony. I think it's very critical for us to have interconnected workflows all across. So this goes back to the theme of our topic here, which is around readiness for agentic AI, not just being cool with AI, but how do we do that boring work on infrastructure, governance, security, and cloud to be ready. As Laxman pointed out, Southwest Gas has been winning a number of awards. That's for a reason, because they are highly innovative, they think very carefully, but also move with velocity. So it's great to learn from them how they are embarking on their journey, and IBM and AWS have a small role to play in their journey to agentic AI.

[![Thumbnail 280](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/280.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=280)

With that, I'll hand it over to Balakalyan to talk about some of the business challenges  they were experiencing when they were on-premises and how it was hindering the innovation. Thank you, Pankaj. Thanks everyone for joining us today. I will walk you through our business challenges when we were on-premises.  Our on-premises infrastructure was aged infrastructure and the most challenges were maintaining those servers. So we had to spend a lot on maintaining those systems and upgrading those servers. And also the scalability, so we couldn't be able to extend according to our business demand. So it was restricting our support for demand.

And also the security and compliance complexity, where our team needs to manually update the patches to avoid security vulnerabilities. And also I would like to hold a bit here on the lack of ability to do agentic AI. I would like to relate to my personal case where a few months ago I thought of teaching AI to my kids, though they're too young. But you know, to do some fun AI stuff, videos and all that stuff, but my old laptop was not supporting those innovative activities.

Similarly, when you compare it in a broader way, a company having aged infrastructure needs a platform, a strong platform, a future-ready digital core platform where you can explore more innovation. That's what we did at Southwest Gas, and thanks to our leadership for taking this innovative step forward and implementing SAP RISE on AWS altogether. We are ready to start our innovation journey, and we already did a couple of use cases on agentic AI, and I'd like Laxman to talk about our SAP RISE journey. Thank you.

[![Thumbnail 400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=400)

 So as a part of our cloud-first journey and also exiting our on-premise infrastructure, we moved the first SAP mission-critical system to AWS running on SAP on RISE. This year, we were able to move everything that we have in our SAP landscape and simplify the architecture, and also integrations from going from PI to BTP Integration Suite. We have done everything in four months. That's why we won Fast and Furious Cloud ERP Migration in SAP Utilities this year.

How we were able to do that is because of the partnership that we have with SAP, IBM, and AWS. IBM is our strategic partner. IBM is the global partner for SAP as well as AWS. We use IBM's strategic partnership to ensure the speed and the timelines that we need are aligned with the project timelines, so this is one of the key partnerships I want to highlight. Having IBM supporting us on not just SAP, we also started moving our on-premise systems like the rest of the systems which are running on Oracle, with 70% of the workload going to the AWS cloud infrastructure. So this is allowing us to prepare for the next generation of digital adoption.

### From Infrastructure to Innovation: Implementing Agentic AI for Customer Service

As Southwest Gas, we are growing organically. We are adding 40,000 customers in our business territory every year, and our business requirements are changing. Our customer demands are increasing, and also we actually take pride in serving our customers and making it easy for them to know how they interact with us. We are the number one mobile app powered by SAP in North America with 86,000 five-star reviews in the Apple Store. I believe there is no other company that has this many reviews, even at the global level, for 2.3 million customers.

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=600)

So we take very seriously when we do these large transformation projects, and you know, keeping in mind and ensuring that how we are going to serve these customers better with the infrastructure that we are going to get into. We see already tremendous improvements with our SAP RISE running on AWS just by migrating it. We will cover this in some other slides. So again, performance is increased by 35%,  just going from our old on-premise hardware infrastructure to AWS.

Our latest and greatest infrastructure, we didn't tune anything. It's just a migration. Actually, the cloud computing power of AWS allowed us to run faster. We used to run mission-critical jobs, which is called meter-to-cash, every night from 6:00 all the way to 2:00 o'clock, which is very important for us. Now, after going to SAP RISE, we are actually completing that within midnight. So that allows our resources to sleep early and also ensures that we bill our customers every day without any issues.

And also, this is helping us because we are able to capitalize with the help of IBM. IBM was able to provide us the language that we need, work with our accounting, and work with our partners to allow us to capitalize. This is a very important aspect for us when it comes to capitalization. And also, the resources that are supporting the on-premise environment, they are now focusing on learning more AWS cloud operations and doing more optimization and automations so that they don't have to do the same level of jobs that they were doing. Our goal is to try to move away from keeping the lights on hours to innovate faster. This is really helping us with moving the responsibilities of managing by customer to managing by SAP and AWS, helping us to innovate much faster.

[![Thumbnail 740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/740.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=740)

Thank you, Lakshman. So I'll be talking about  AI use cases that are already in the implementation phase. So our company, Southwest Gas, embraced  Agentic AI. And when we approached customer agents and asked about what are the pain areas, they said these were some of the questions they were unable to answer quickly to the customers. That's when we thought of building an Agentic AI for Smart Gas Bill Analyzer, where most of the customers used to ask why my bill is high. They don't just consider some root cause analysis or whatever. It used to take currently over 10 to 15 minutes, and it could lead to frustration for the customers.

[![Thumbnail 790](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/790.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=790)

[![Thumbnail 810](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/810.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=810)

So what are the challenges that  currently our agents are facing, how this AI could help, and what are the business values that it can gain customer trust, reduce disputes, and reduce the call volume? I would like to go through the root cause analysis  that we found for building this Agentic AI case. So there are three categories. One is customer-related reasons that could be behavioral changes while using these appliances and making more consumption. One could be inefficient appliances, like customers are using some degrading systems, HVAC systems, or water heaters, and also some behavioral changes. Maybe some of the customers could keep the appliance uses for a longer period, and everything resides in a system, right?

[![Thumbnail 880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=880)

So what our Agentic AI can do is it extracts the data from the systems that are mentioned there, from MDMS and billing systems and also from S4 and customer support portal, and it can reason. It can extract the data and fine-tune and validate and provide the actual reason and give an insightful summary to the  customer agents. So the second category is due to some faulty technical reasons like faulty machines or equipment. Maybe sometimes the smart devices won't work, or the meter may be faulty meters there, and due to some longer billing cycles, that could be also a reason, and additional tariffs or rate plan changes that could also lead to increased bills.

[![Thumbnail 910](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/910.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=910)

 We cannot deny the fact that external factors like weather play a significant role. Mostly in cold weather, customers switch on their heaters, which could also increase their bills, particularly gas bills. Additionally, rate changes and sometimes regulatory-applied surcharges can lead to higher bills as well. During outages, some customers feel that even though their bill is high and outages have occurred, this can be due to some of the consumption patterns afterward. All this data can be extracted from the relevant systems and then fed to our Agentic AI, and what Agentic AI can do is intelligently validate and provide proper reasoning to our call center agents.

[![Thumbnail 960](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/960.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=960)

 In a holistic view, our Agentic AI can be handled intelligently. This is our Smart Gas Bill Analyzer where it can answer multiple prompts or multiple requests that we ask the Agentic AI, and it can give us AI-driven insights with proper reasoning. Let's say, suppose a customer asks how can I reduce my bill, then it can advise them to switch over to smart plans so that they can reduce a certain amount every month. It can also compare the usage with similar households in nearby locations. If there are any disputes, it can answer how these can be raised, and it can also break down the bill. If a customer asks to break down my bill, then it can segregate and show it to the customers as well.

[![Thumbnail 1030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/1030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=1030)

 There are other use cases that I'd like Lakshman to talk about, specifically the regulatory rate case submission. Yeah, I know we have two minutes time coming up, so we'll just quickly cover this. How many of you are utility customers here? How many of you are utility customers? You can imagine that rate case is very important for us as a utility.

[![Thumbnail 1050](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/1050.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=1050)

 What we're trying to do is come up with some use cases where we can get all the data in such a way that all the utilities' Public Utility Commission requests, whether it is invoices, whether it is bills, everything that needs to be asked, can be addressed. We are working through AI use cases, connecting all our SAP and Oracle systems and trying to provide work order numbers and then all the relevant information related to that which is required to submit to our Public Utility Commissions. Again, this is something very important for us as a utility. We will talk more in our next upcoming sessions when we have successfully completed everything end to end, but this is something we want to be developing and we want to be one of the leading utilities to be part of it.

[![Thumbnail 1120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/bc363607912c9d01/1120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT-LqYflC3I&t=1120)

Thank you, Lakshman.  Just in summary, we started with the challenges today that we see in adoption of Agentic AI, the forecast of the failure rates, and what IBM is doing to make sure we are equipping our clients to be successful. Watch this space. Southwest Gas is highly innovative. They move with velocity, and partners like AWS, ourselves, and SAP are working towards making them more successful. They have the vision, they do the execution. I'm sure when you switch on your heat tonight, think about this case study, think about Southwest Gas. Thank you. We'll be around to answer more questions. Thank you.
