### Introducing Kadenja: A Chat App That Transforms Home Appliances into Family Members

 Good afternoon, everyone. We're almost halfway through re:Invent 2025. How are you doing? Very good. Let's start my presentation. My title is "Build a Chat App for Smart Home Appliances." My name is Yuki Ogawa from Mitsubishi Electric. Today I will show you our project. The name is Kadenja. Kadenja is a combined term, the combination of "kaden" in Japanese, which means home appliances, and "Avengers." Maybe you know or have heard of the Avengers, the superhero team. It's also a combination with the term "challengers." Kadenja is a chat app that lets people interact with smart home appliances as though they were family members.

 Let's move on to the self-introduction again. I work as a developer on an IoT platform called Linova, and I also work on a home appliances smartphone application called MyMU. I'm honored to have received some awards from AWS and AWS Japan, including Community Builder and Japan All AWS Certifications Engineer and Top Engineer in Japan. I'm also active in the AWS community, both inside Mitsubishi Electric, which is called MAWS-UG, Mitsubishi Electric AWS User Group, and externally in JAWS-UG, the Japan AWS User Group. I'm a leader in the Kyoto branch. My favorite AWS services are Amazon Kinesis and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. In today's keynote, two functions were released in AgentCore.

 This is the agenda of my presentation. Today I will cover four topics: the concept of the product, the application and the user experience, a short demo about two minutes, and after that I'll describe the overall architecture. Let's move on to the concept of the product.

[![Thumbnail 150](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/150.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=150)

 IoT-enabled home appliances let people control these devices easily from anywhere and anytime. From the user's side, this is very convenient and very powerful. But when we think from the appliances' side, the relationship is mostly command and responses. We wanted to imagine something warmer and more natural relationships between human beings and home appliances. Our inspiration was the idea of loving your home appliances more.

[![Thumbnail 190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=190)

 We imagined a world where users do not just command but talk to them and grow close to them, almost like family. We designed the product Kadenja to engage in friendly and useful interactions, not annoyance.

[![Thumbnail 210](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/210.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=210)

 In our application, each appliance has an avatar and a personality that fits its function. The avatar responds to the user's commands and prompts in a way that feels natural for the device. Avatars can also talk with each other, creating conversations. For example, a refrigerator might remind the oven about the ingredients for a recipe. Now I'll play a two-minute video demo that demonstrates the experience.

  I'm Big Chill Taro. Ciao, I'm Coony Breeze. Hola, I'm Brownie Vision.   It's cold winter, so I recommend hot pot or warm udon noodles.  Hot pot is great on cold days. Taro was recommending hot pot noodles. It's cold today, so let's watch something warm too.  Brownie, that's a great suggestion.

    Yeah, to watch videos. So I want to eat udon noodle because it's a cold day today.

### Technical Architecture: Building Multi-Agent Conversations with AWS Services and Amazon Bedrock

So, yeah, let's move on to  the explanation about the architecture. Here's the overall architecture of the application. So not only do we deploy agents for each appliance avatar, but we also have an agent managing the memory system and the memory calendar. The front end uses React Router, GSAP, and Pixi JS, all of which are built by Amazon Q Developer, currently unified under the name of Amazon Q. Conversations between users and the avatars are managed in DynamoDB and connected to the front end via GraphQL through AppSync. Additionally, since we often use a serverless architecture, the back end is primarily built around Lambda and Step Functions.

[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=430)

So we have four features  in this architecture. I would like to explain each feature. The first one is the unique personality and features of each appliance avatar. Each appliance agent includes a system prompt and a personal profile that differentiates its voice and behavior. We also maintain an allowed list so agents can call only approved device APIs. Personas can be tuned for dialect and topic preferences, and we use Llama's template and safety constraints to keep replies safe and appropriate. Agents can invoke external APIs like switchboard APIs in this case to perform diverse actions and retrieve context-aware information such as energy use or recipe suggestions.

[![Thumbnail 490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=490)

 The second feature is a personalized knowledge base. We use a structured knowledge model using a graph database via Amazon Neptune. Nodes represent utterances and preferences, while edges capture relationships and temporal context. We combine rule-based heuristics with learned models to assess the importance of information and effectively store only high-impact memories from every conversation. By analyzing conversation flow, agents gradually learn context and improve future replies.

[![Thumbnail 540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=540)

The third feature is a memory calendar.  In the demo, in the last of the demos I played, the video demo, that one is the memory calendar. Conversations are preserved in layered forms such as text summaries, images such as thumbnails for memorable moments, and short video clips when relevant. This creates story-like memories that you can browse like a picture diary. We also classify topics so the agent can retrieve relevant past interactions and enrich future replies.

[![Thumbnail 580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=580)

 The last feature is a conversation mediator. We use a mediator to keep the multi-avatar conversation smooth and comfortable. The mediator scores candidate replies for relevance, confidence, and personal fit. It enforces constraints such as one utterance per avatar to prevent one avatar from dominating the conversation.

[![Thumbnail 620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=620)

The merit is the natural turn-taking and the very rapid crosstalk or flip-flop, so interaction feels calm and human.  I think maybe you're wondering why we're not using Amazon Bedrock Agent Core. At that time, we couldn't adopt Amazon Bedrock Agent Core because it was still pre-release when we developed it. However, many features could likely be replaced by Amazon Bedrock Agent Core, I think.

Agent Core runtime runs AI agent frameworks like LangChain agents or Agent Core on Amazon Bedrock LLMs, which speeds up agent hosting and development. Agent Core gateway covers the existing APIs and functions into MCP-compatible tools so agents can easily call diverse functions. Memory, identical memory, manages the memory access for short-term and long-term stores, providing agents with the right content at the right time.

[![Thumbnail 690](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/690.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=690)

If you recall the video demo, I typically show the interaction looks like this. A user asks,  what should I cook tonight? The refrigerator avatar checks the available ingredients inside and suggests options. Then it's the turn for the oven avatar, which processes the recipe and schedules reheating. The mediator makes sure each of them speaks in turn and their actions are safe and coordinated. This flow shows how context-aware suggestions and general personality can make diverse interactions more delightful.

[![Thumbnail 730](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7098fa8b4cdd4398/730.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab7FuwuZLz0&t=730)

 To summarize the challenges, this is a chat application with your home appliances. We turn household appliances into friendly agents with distinct personalities. We combine agent runtime and MCP to generate multimodal memory to deliver context-aware and safe interactions. The result is higher user engagement and a more delightful user experience with reusable tools and an architecture that scales on AWS.

 Thank you for your kind attention, and if you have any questions, please ask me after the session. Have a great day.
