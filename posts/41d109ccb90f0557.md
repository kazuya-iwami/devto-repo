### Introduction: Accelerating Mainframe Modernization with Agentic AI and AWS Transform

 Today we are going to talk about the exciting story of mainframe modernization. It may not sound exciting from the title, but once we dive in, I promise it will be. I have with me our esteemed customers Will Holloway from Western Union and Jeremiah Moody from Unum. They are going to talk about the mainframe modernization journey using the  Agentic AI composable framework with AWS Transform. This is all possible because of our co-innovation with our partner Accenture. Accenture, working with Western Union, built this composable agentic AI solution which makes it possible to accelerate the 2X speed for mainframe modernization and take applications from discovery to testing at rapid speed, which we will cover in detail.

Pega worked with Unum and took this entire transformation journey, saving thousands of hours for Unum at a rapid pace while reducing the complexity of applications using low-code and no-code approaches. We created the composable solution with AWS Transform. Without further delay, let me start with what we are going to cover. We will provide a quick overview of AWS Transform and why it matters. We will talk about composability and what challenges it solves. This is a new concept where we propose to build a composable solution with the customer, the partner, and AWS to avoid market confusion about which tool to use. Ultimately, we want to modernize the workload and help customers on this journey.

### AWS Transform: The First Agentic Service for Large-Scale Migration and Modernization

We will then go through more technical details and learn about the architecture, how we thought about composability, and how we are making it possible to implement. Finally, we will hear directly from Western Union and Unum, our esteemed customers. AWS Transform is the first agentic service for  large-scale migration and modernization. It has four pillars: Assessment, VMware, Mainframe, and .NET. Using Gen AI and Agentic AI, you can perform these transformations at a rapid pace. What used to take years can now be done in a month. What takes a month can now be done in weeks or days. In this session, I will especially focus on AWS Transform for the Mainframe and some capabilities you see here on the screen.

It automates the entire transformation process from end to end. Whether you are in the assessment phase looking at decades of old code, if we talk about COBOL code, this is the most challenging. It was written over the last two to four decades, with layer upon layer of code built on top of it. What happens finally is that there is so much technical debt and so much knowledge loss because people wrote code, retired, and took their knowledge with them. It becomes a black box. With that black box, customers cannot take risk because they do not know what is inside. They cannot make a plan for how they are going to modernize.

That is where AWS Transform comes in. It provides the capability to go through millions of lines of code and create technical documentation, functional documentation, and business rule extraction in weeks or days. This gives you the idea of what to do with this application. Now you understand what is inside the black box. Do you want to take the refactor path? Do you want to change from COBOL to Java? AWS Transform provides the agent for that. Do you want to have industry knowledge base there? We have the composable agent with Accenture which provides that. Do you want to get insight into the scheduler? We have the CICS agent with composable solution with Accenture. This provides our customers the ability to understand all business rule extraction and maybe get rid of all code and go to the low-code, no-code path which Pega Blueprint provides, and that is what we are going to listen to here.

After that, there is lots of effort going into testing. Today we launched automated testing in AWS Transform, and there is another session for that, so I will not talk much about that.

[![Thumbnail 320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=320)

### Composability: Solving Tool Confusion and Stakeholder Misalignment

Data migration is another pain point, which is why end-to-end migration is now available. When we launched AWS Transform with another name last year, and then we launched AWS Transform again in May this year, we started seeing some challenges. Our partners have built these tools and main frameworks that they have been handling for three to four decades, and they have built tools around them. Then there are AWS tools, and there are different tools from various ISVs and GSIs. Now they have confusion. Even though their business case is saying to move and modernize their workload, there was a slowdown happening because of tool confusion. 

[![Thumbnail 400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=400)

These different tool proposals coming to them create overlapping tools, making it difficult to take a decision and move forward. The second challenge is stakeholder misalignment. If someone is proposing a different tool versus a different pattern, whether we should go to forward engineering or reverse engineering, and whether we are doing a refactor or replace, there is an integration challenge. If I have 56 different tools that I want to use—one for discovery, one for code conversion, one for testing, one for integration—these are all working in silos. How do we bring them together? That is where we introduced composability. 

[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=430)

[![Thumbnail 440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=440)

Composability brings out the best of all available tools in the market. That is what we create: one plus one is better than two. If AWS Transform has some agent with some differentiator, and then partners like Accenture and Pega have their differentiators, we bring the best of all the tools together and drive the co-build and co-sell motion. How do we do that? We have the AWS migration and modernization agent, and then we have third-party agent registration where we work with partners like Accenture and Pega.  

[![Thumbnail 450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/450.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=450)

The customer can also bring their own agent, and then we have this agent orchestration layer. I will talk more about the agent orchestration. That is where we design the overall agentic workflow. Whether this agent is going to work side by side—for example, if I have the FSI knowledge-based agent by Accenture and then I have this knowledge base with code I am creating through the BRE by AWS Transform—these two agents need to work side by side. That is where orchestration comes in, where we have a supervisor agent handling those agents side by side. 

[![Thumbnail 490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=490)

Another orchestration approach could be linear. I first want to do the transformation, then testing, then data migration, and all those kinds of orchestration are also available. This is the co-innovation initiative where we are empowering the migration competency partner to integrate our tools, agents, and industry knowledge together and bring the best for our customers to make the right decision and expedite their journey using the latest and greatest technology. 

[![Thumbnail 520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=520)

Some of the use cases I already talked about include enhanced knowledge for customized workflow. When we are doing customized workflow, everyone has heard about the MCP now, and MCP is that smart API which does not require lots of hardwired coding. If you have the MCP server with your agent hosted on that, and we have the AWS Transform agent in an MCP server, they can easily talk to each other and easily orchestrate these entire things. Then you can bring the new agent, and that is how it helps to expand the technology and scale through the partners. 

[![Thumbnail 560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/560.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=560)

Looking at how composability is driving the value, first, for the partner, it definitely gives you the market differentiator where you can co-build and say that you are bringing the best of the breed together and create the co-sell motion for the customer. They get a tailored solution. Now we are not force-fitting them to a solution that is already in the market. We are saying you tell us your problem, and working backward, we will create the solution for you which is the best fit for you. 

Finally, for AWS, the legacy technology is so broad that we cannot build everything, and it is hard to scale. We do not want to build everything. That is where we want to scale through the partner. It gives us more technology expansion.

[![Thumbnail 620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=620)

### Technical Architecture: Agent Registration, Orchestration, and Security

AWS Transform gives us more expanded technology portfolio, and on top of that, co-innovation with our partners, which is very important. Some of the capabilities you will see is agent registration capability.  If you're bringing your agent, it will get registered with AWS Transform. There are the API and the controls. So there is MCP server control, then there will be A2A agent-to-agent protocol which creates the orchestration, and you will have secure runtime routing.

[![Thumbnail 640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/640.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=640)

Where AWS Transform sits in the overall portfolio is important to understand.  This is the agentic AI or overall LLM agentic AI portfolio of AWS, with these different layers of capabilities provided. You will see that the application layer with AWS Transform sitting there, and most of the capabilities are here at no charge to customers and partners. Then you see the Bedrock agent. You can build your agent using the Bedrock agent, or if you want, you can bring your agent because it is hosted in the agent corps. So you can bring your agent even if you put it into the LangGraph or all open source. You can bring it into the agent corps. If you want, you can use the different models which are available through Bedrock, whether it is Claude, whether it is Llama, or any model or Nova, whatever model you want to use.

[![Thumbnail 700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=700)

So how does this overall flow work?  First, a partner can create an agent on their development environment or local environment. We do your AWS account as an allow list and you use the Bedrock agent to build your agent. We extend you the AWS Transform primitive AWS Transform base agent, which will help you to build the agent locally and do the testing. Once you are satisfied that your capability is working well in the agent, you can take that and deploy it in ECS and put it into the agent corps. After that, it will start talking to AWS Transform because it got registered there. Then the customer can have the communication using the chat agent there. By the way, we have a very broad demo available at the mainframe booth, so you can always go and play around with that and see how these agents are working together. We have this at the Venetian Expo at the mainframe booth.

[![Thumbnail 770](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/770.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=770)

Obviously, security is the most important thing, and we understand that especially with mainframe, lots of industry workloads are there from FII customers and SCLS customers.  So you will have the data secure with VPC-enabled runtime, so your data is isolated. You have fine-grained IAM policy, so you know who can assess your agents and who cannot. Finally, you want to know what your agent is doing, so you have the logging, observability, and the agent compliance. With that, I would like to invite Will Holloway from Western Union to talk about how they modernized their Western Union journey using AWS Transform and Accenture's composable solution. Welcome, Will.

### Western Union's Journey: Modernizing Money Order Platform with AWS Transform and Accenture

Thank you, Rob. This is interesting. This is my first re:Invent appearance, and with all the headphones, I kind of feel like a silent DJ or  a silent rave. So no Skrillex, no nothing like that. Unfortunately for you, I'm merely Will Holloway, and I run the consumer services operations for Western Union's non-money transfer products. As mentioned, we're partnering with AWS and Accenture to pilot this AWS Transform technology to see if we can modernize our money order platform. We'll talk through that in due time. Before that, I'll talk a little bit about Western Union, and I'm sure many of you know of Western Union  primarily through our money transfer service, but we have a very long history of additional products as well as technological breakthroughs over the years. Starting in 1851, we pioneered the first telegraph. Shortly thereafter, about 10 years later, we started our flagship money transfer service. Moving into 1914, we actually developed the first consumer charge card and shared that out. Then moving into the 1960s, to the delight of our customers and dentists all over the country, we started delivering candy grams.

[![Thumbnail 930](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/930.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=930)

We now span the globe over 200 different countries with just about 500,000 individual retail locations. It took 170 years, but we grew quite large. 

Let's talk about today and Western Union right now. Some of you may have tuned into our investor day last month, and if you did, we talked a lot about "beyond remittances." Obviously, remittance is a money transfer, right? It's the industry we're in. Our executive team and our shareholders decided that we're going to commit to going beyond remittances over the next three years. What that means for us as a company, myself included, is we want to grow consumer services revenue from 15 percent of total revenue to 25 percent by 2028.

What that means for me is I've got to deliver a billion dollars in revenue over the next three years and grow the products to scale, which brings us to why we're talking today. The other interesting thing that we found out is that 70 percent of our receivers across the globe are interested in additional financial services products. Some of you might have moved money in an emergency, some of you might rely on it. Our customer base consists of those looking for products that a non-banked customer might live day in and day out on. We're really pushing in on that, and that's really what Beyond is all about.

[![Thumbnail 1030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/1030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=1030)

Let's talk about where we want to apply this mainframe.  I own consumer services operations, and money order is the biggest product in that. Money order is offered only in the US and Canada. Currently, you can only cash or deposit them in the US and Canada. Some of you might be familiar with money order. Some of you may have bought one. If you bought a money order in the past, you may think it's a bit old, a bit outdated.

Let me ask you to guess how many money orders are sold each year in the United States. The answer is upwards of 110 million. Yes, it's definitely not new, but there's definitely a need for it, especially with our customer base, the unbanked populations of North America. The answer is a resounding yes, so we have to continue to provide service for them and we have to build on top of what we've got.

[![Thumbnail 1120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/1120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=1120)

What are the challenges we have with money order?  I can tell you for a fact there's no way that we're going to be able to hit our 500 million dollar growth target in our current setup. Partially, engineering expertise is dwindling. We need to build and prepare for this volume growth in a cost-efficient and dynamic manner. We need to roll out new solutions, new ways to do this, and we need our mainframe or an improved modern version of that to scale with us.

We need different features and functionality to take an old idea and make it applicable and relevant in a digital age. I need mainframe technology to do that. Most importantly, we need to improve our back office operations. While it may seem very simple, it takes maybe 15 separate teams across Western Union.

Presentment operations, refunds, customer support, agent support—all these different teams are required just to run what seems like a really simple piece of paper. Right now, all of those teams are using the terminal screens to run tens of millions in money orders each month. I've got to overcome that because it's starting to hamstring us a bit.

[![Thumbnail 1230](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/1230.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=1230)

 So what are we focusing on? These are three things here, and of course I just touched on back office, so that's one. But this bit here—one product, three personas—I kind of alluded to it just now. With the money order, there are three different hands that touch it. Obviously, our customers buy it. Our retail frontline agents sell it. And then those fourteen to fifteen or so back office teams make sure that when you cash it, you get the money, make sure that when you want to refund it, you get the refund, or if you've been defrauded, we help you get your money back.

We've got to build this product, which was theoretically one directional, to support all three people here. Customers need self-service tools. My agents need to be able to manage, engage, and help those customers when they walk in. And then I've got to make the back office work well. All that to say, I think it's a given that money order, if you're familiar with alternative financial products, runs on account clearing, which is a bit slow in today's modern age. So I've got to make it as fast as I possibly can to match the bank's speeds so that when you're cashing in or using mobile deposit, I can give you approval or denial very quickly on what that money order should or should not be cashed or deposited as.

[![Thumbnail 1340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/1340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=1340)

We're running a pilot. If you look at this up here, you can obviously see  all the different steps that we mentioned. Right now, Q4 2025, we're working through this pilot. We've got a little ways to go. While I understand all this, I'm not necessarily the person who thinks that Rob mentioned. You said Will can tell you how to build it. I can't tell you at all how to build this thing. What I can tell you is what I want it to look like and what my team needs it to look like so that we can achieve what I just mentioned beforehand.

For me, human-centric design is what I'm mostly interested in. We've got to break out of the terminal windows, which I've tried and tried and tried, and I'll just stick to Outlook and meetings. I'm not going to try any harder. We've got to build this in a way that all those personas are supported and I can scale it. Right now, my customer support representatives can't do all the things that I need them to do. Why would I train tier one customer support on how to leverage the terminal window and go through all that?

Joel and the AWS team have helped me understand what is possible and how to go from this archaic visual and really make a modern user feel and push that forward. I think with all these pieces, all the accurate transformations, all the validation will help us move money order into a modern era, like I said. So this, for me, is the end all be all. For me, tech for tech's sake is not a good thing. I don't just want to bring in tech. I want to bring in solutions. To me, all these steps here in this year's worth of engagement is to bring a means to an end and to help us modernize money order better than the competition has and really create a new digitized money order the best we can.

[![Thumbnail 1480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/1480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=1480)

 Speaking of not being able to describe how to build it, my favorite slide. You can read up here. You can see all the architecture diagrams. You can see how the individual agents are talking to each other. Of course, Transform is operating in tandem with the Accenture agents. The great thing here is it's all running securely on our AWS instances.

The agents are evaluating the processes and the architecture we laid out. For me, being new to mainframe details, it's evaluating our performance on the mainframe. What we're getting from this is not only the ability to migrate like for like, which is obviously extremely important—I want to make sure that whatever I'm getting on my current solution I'm getting the same outcome—but I want it done quicker, faster, better, stronger. It's evaluating the performance and evaluating how to make things more efficient with fewer lines of code.

An interesting aspect here for a user like myself is working through a chatbot solution to simplify the engineering aspect of things. As I mentioned, mainframe engineering expertise is going down. We're losing it due to a lot of churn and retention risks in that area. This chatbot solution simplifies that and reduces the complexity of what's truly needed when you migrate these resources or you change teams. A really cool thing about it is we're able to keep our current context and nomenclature intact. Just because I'm moving something that's been around for 35 years at Western Union doesn't necessarily mean I have to change everything that people refer to things as. I'm sure we're going to change some things, but I don't have to unless I really want to, which is quite nice, especially for a mix of new resources coming on to support this as well as existing resources.

[![Thumbnail 1630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/1630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=1630)



You can read the details here. Just over 2.5 million lines of code. I want to talk about speed here. Throughout the pilot, which we're still running through, we've got some good results. In only a month and a half, we managed to set up infrastructure, transform the code, and start testing this code, which to my understanding is about half the time it would have taken with traditional approaches. Not only that, but 53,000 lines of COBOL were converted in just about an hour and a half.

For technical documentation, which is obviously important for a migration activity, 31 elements were completed in 19 hours using the Accenture agents, and then we completed all the business requirements docs in about 5 hours. For data migration, 21 VSAM files and 25 DB2 tables were moved in this effort without any accuracy or transfer issues. So far, we've had very resounding progress with a lot of good efforts on both sides.

[![Thumbnail 1720](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/1720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=1720)



So again, what's our purpose behind this? Why are we doing it? I have to increase the speed and the usability for all the people touching money order—for the customer, for the internal teams, for the agents—and that's the primary focus. From what we laid out here, I feel very strongly that our approach and the partnership that we've laid out will put us on the path for taking what has historically been a time-tested product and developing it for the modern era. I believe we can drastically continue our growth in a market that we've held dominant and continue to pull business from the competition because of the features that we're going to bring to money order with this AWS transform tech.

### Achieving 2X Speed: From Discovery to Testing in Six Weeks

So you heard from the benefits. He is talking about many things in the hours like converting thousands of lines of code and how moving things works, and the most important is the 2X speed, which used to take 3 or more months traditionally. Now it is possible with the AWS Transform composable solution to achieve this in 6 weeks from discovery to testing,

which is pretty impressive results. We have a similar story with Unum, and I would like to invite Jay to talk about the transformation journey with Pega.

### Unum's Transformation: Eliminating Tech Debt with AWS Transform and Pega Blueprint

Hi, thanks. Welcome to re:Invent and thanks for coming to listen to Unum's journey with AWS Transform and Pega. I know we're at the witching hour right after lunch where everybody's getting a little sleepy, so if you would please indulge me in a little exercise. If you're here because you're interested in legacy modernization and transformation, please stand up. Awesome, most of us are awake. If you're still sitting, then you've fallen victim maybe to postprandial sleepiness. Please remain standing. Yes, you're not awake yet.

If you've not started your transformation journey, please have a seat. If you have not completed your transformation journey, please have a seat. All right, we're thinning out. If you have not completed your journey and you deem it a success, so if it's not a success or you're not sure, please have a seat. Have a quick look around folks because there's one other person you want to talk to in the hallway. Thank you very much for indulging me.

My name is Jay Moody. I'm the AVP of IT Delivery and the Digital Process Automation Group at Unum. I'm relatively new to the organization, going on a year, but I have about 10+ years of state, federal, and public sector consulting, 15+ years of Pega solutions architecture experience, and over 20 years in the IT industry. But I think what's most important is that I consider myself, or at least I strive to be, an empathetic practical problem solver. Ultimately, I think empathy is absolutely key here because even though we're here to talk about these incredible technologies, AWS Transform and Pega, underneath everything this is all about people and this transformation touches real lives in real ways.

A little bit about Unum: we are an insurance company. We offer employer-sponsored benefits like life, disability, accident, supplemental benefits, dental, and vision. We've also been around for about 175 years or more actually, which is a lot of time to accumulate all kinds of legacy technology. We're headquartered in Chattanooga, Tennessee, but we have offices all over the globe. I actually hail from the beautiful state of Maine, Portland, Maine. You guys should visit, but probably wait till the summer.

Unum's mission, its whole purpose, is to protect people financially when they're ill or injured or when they ultimately need it most. Colonial Life is a subsidiary of Unum. We service about 3.7 million lives and 90,000 organizations and companies. We're really good at what we do. I'm new to the organization, but I see it everywhere. People care, they're really good at what they do, and we're number 2 in whole life and universal, 3 in accident and hospital indemnity. But that doesn't mean that we stop trying to improve.

The organization has a culture of innovation and improvement, and that's what we're doing here today. The way we're doing it is really awesome. We're using AWS Transform, so AI, and Pega, also AI, to streamline and modernize our Colonial claims processing. In doing so, we're eliminating tech debt that's been around for ages, and we're doing it in months, not years.

As I mentioned, we've been around for 175+ years, so of course there are some challenges, or as I like to call them, opportunities.

Every challenge is an opportunity, and those opportunities exist in both our systems and our processes. Taking our claims examiners as an example, I was fortunate enough to sit with some examiners and watch them do their daily jobs. At any given point while adjudicating one claim, they have two windows open full of different screens—seven different windows total. This represents fragmented workflows with manual processing and systems scattered all over the place.

Our claims managers present another significant opportunity. We have nine managers in this particular unit, and it takes them about three hours a day just to manually assign work to their examiners. That's twenty-seven hours in one day, one hundred thirty-five hours in a week, and seven thousand hours in a year spent on manual processing assignments to workers. From a systems perspective, these transactions happen fast. Mainframes are fast and perform as they're supposed to, but what they lack is flexibility.

[![Thumbnail 2220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/2220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=2220)

The rate at which businesses are required to change these days is getting faster and faster, and these systems need to be very flexible. Mainframes are not particularly flexible, and they're not well documented. When you have a system that's not well documented, it's extremely difficult to maintain, let alone improve. Of course, we're always looking to improve.  Our transformation approach is nothing out of the ordinary. You won't see any magic in our approach necessarily. We're going to assess our code and do discovery workshops. We're going to acquire our code, stage and analyze it using transformation and blueprint tools, and then build, validate, and verify. There's no magic here.

One thing I would like to convey is that in the very first minute of this project, in the very first stage and step, we encountered our very first hurdle, which is essentially finding the code. Imagine Bob in his back room basement next to his mainframe that he's worked on for thirty years. You ask Bob where the code is, and he responds with questions: What do you want to know? Why do you want it? Why do you want access? Who's asking? It's very tribal and very protective. Of course, this is where empathy comes in, because we may be replacing code that Bob built thirty years ago and has been maintaining ever since. Empathy is key.

[![Thumbnail 2300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/2300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=2300)

Once we got the code,  what is our first step in modernization? It's imperative that you understand what you're trying to modernize, because if you can't understand it, you can't validate that you're actually modernizing it. What is the code doing? Can we validate it? Can we make sure that it's still doing what it's supposed to do after we modernize it? We did this by uploading our code to an Amazon S3 bucket. We connected AWS Transform to our S3 bucket and asked the agent nicely—because you just don't know—to please analyze our code and extract business rules from our mainframe systems.

[![Thumbnail 2380](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/2380.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=2380)

There were challenges along the way for sure, but it's relatively straightforward to document years of code in hours. There's value there, absolutely.  When we analyzed that code, we found one point five million lines of code. What we got is a business rules extract document that tells us all about it. It shows us the paths that the code takes, who's taking those paths, what persona, what integrations, and what the data models are. After years of code sitting in production with only one person knowing what it does, we now have pages and pages of documentation.

[![Thumbnail 2440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/2440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=2440)

But what are we going to do with all of that documentation? This is where Pega comes in. Pega is a world-class low-code, no-code workflow automation and AI decisioning tool. We're going to upload that to  Pega's Blueprint.

Blueprint is a free tool you can use online. You just sign up for your account and can upload all kinds of different documentation, whether that be your transform business rules, extract, or even a movie of somebody navigating through your green screens. You upload it to Blueprint, and Blueprint will analyze that and pull out workflows. It will organize those workflows into stages and steps and put in their decision points, along with a lot of other cool stuff. But the value here is even greater than that.

This is where you can sit with your subject matter experts, define and refine, and reimagine your processes. It doesn't take an IT technologist to sit down and do this. It's a very visual interface with drag and drop capabilities for really redefining and reimagining your processes. More than that, you can sit with your business folks. This can end up as a contract between IT and business, defining what we're going to build, how we're going to build it, and all of our workflows are captured here. This can be used as sign-off.

[![Thumbnail 2540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/2540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=2540)

We can take this a step further. When we validate and test this, you download your blueprint and import it into your Pega solution.  In our case, we're in the cloud, so we have a cloud-native Pega solution that has all of the infrastructure of AWS. Pega Cloud is built on AWS, so you've got highly scalable, available services backed by a 99.95% availability SLA. You've got disaster recovery, encryption services, backups, and everything that AWS has to offer.

[![Thumbnail 2620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/2620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=2620)

[![Thumbnail 2630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/2630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=2630)

This solution in particular takes advantage of Pega's composable architecture, which we sometimes call the situational layer cake. You have layers of rules, but the right rule fires in the right context at the right time. In our solution, we're able to implement skill-based routing automatically. What happened before and what happens now is out of the box. You've got AI-powered straight-through processing, smart adjudication, operational reporting, and data insights right out of the box.  

Let's bring this back to the people, because this is what we're here to talk about. We're here to talk about technology, but ultimately it's about people. What impact does this have on lives? Remember our claims manager experience: 7,000 hours a year for our claims managers is gone, it's eliminated. Figure out what to do with your time now because your team has 7,000 hours extra in their lives. The claims examiner experience went from 7 different windows to one unified experience. Most importantly, the end user, the claimant, our customer, our end customer, is not sitting around waiting for their claim to be adjudicated to figure out whether it's paid or whether they're missing some information. This is all happening really quickly now, so there's more time in their lives to worry about the important things. That's realized value.

We all know that with these projects sometimes we have to go through the review process. They've got to get funded. We've got to talk about value before we can prove value.

Customer satisfaction is an incredible KPI, but it's really hard to put a number to it and predict the impact it will have. However, you can talk about the decreased risk with mainframes, the decreased cost of ownership, and leaving that hard to maintain legacy system in the past where it belongs. A few years ago, we had two vendors come in and give us a similar quote to do what we're doing now at 7 years for $25 million. We went from COBOL to cloud with a testable application in 3 months.

I want to encourage you while you're on your modernization journey to innovate empathetically. Thank you to Jay and Will. You can see how the AWS Transform and composable solution helps to provide the speed, scale, and innovation  and brings this journey from months to days. This increased the velocity we created through this agent, we created the automation, and we formed this partnership.

### Partner Ecosystem and Available Resources for Mainframe Modernization

When talking about the partnership, you can see at the top  the Accenture and Pega story, and Capgemini has built the agent. You can see all these top three agents in the booth, and then we have others like IBM, Infosys, Deloitte, TCS, and we have ISV partners which include Precisely, CAST, Redux, Karsun Solutions, and OpenLegacy. These are our early onboarding partners who have built the agent ahead of time and the composable solutions they are building.

All these demos are available. If you want to visualize how it looks, you can head to the expo. I'm going to head there after this. If you want to visualize the architecture  diagram, you can see it here. These are the capabilities we  launched today. If you missed that session, you can see the application reimagining, activity analysis, data analysis, and enhanced chat experience. We have put the entire test automation and expanded availability in 8 or 9 more regions. AWS Transform is available, and these are the different sessions available so you can go and learn about all of this.

[![Thumbnail 2900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/41d109ccb90f0557/2900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh1ob94cxA8&t=2900)

We have very deep hands-on workshops available for all the paths. Do you want to take it to the reimagined path using Pega? Or creating applications from scratch? Looking at the business logic extraction, you will find the workshop here. If you're looking at data augmentation or refactoring, all the workshops are listed here, and all the exciting sessions are available. Thank you for your time today. I hope you'll learn new things from here and I'm looking forward to working with our customers and partners to make mainframe modernization great again. You can see all these sessions and workshops available  for all the different paths and levels.
