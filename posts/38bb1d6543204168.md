### The Freedom to Build: From First Programs to AI Agents

    I want you to close your eyes for a moment. I want you to think back to the time you first successfully built your first program. Do you remember that sense of accomplishment and freedom that you can create anything you want? That exhilarating feeling that you just unlocked a whole new world  of possibilities. Now open your eyes.

[![Thumbnail 170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=170)

For me, it was when I first wrote a program for a scientific calculator back in the early days of my high school. You might be wondering what a bizarre choice that was and why I picked it. It's because I didn't have a scientific calculator. I had a simple kind.  But it took me a few tries before I got it right, as I didn't have a computer in my home when I was growing up. My high school had one computer that all of us shared, so I got access to it about ten to twenty minutes a week. I had to type fast whenever I got access to it and then try.

[![Thumbnail 190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=190)


Of course, I didn't get it right the first time because I didn't get all the corner cases, string parsing, and various things.  But when I finally got it right, I was so proud that I built something I didn't have before. Suddenly, the kid in me felt that I could solve extremely hard problems and build things I didn't have. Finally, I was free to imagine and create. 

[![Thumbnail 240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/240.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=240)

Today, builders around the world are experiencing that same sense of freedom with the help of AI agents. But what makes this moment special and a game changer in the tech industry and in the history of tech are two things. First, who can build is rapidly changing. We are no longer constrained by the familiarity of the syntax of language or having to remember hundreds of API calls and parameters.  Second, how quickly you can build is also changing. What used to take years now takes months. What used to take months now takes weeks, if not days.



We are living in times of great change. For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution.  Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.

### Real-World Impact: Ocean Cleanup and Brain Research with AI

Take, for example, Ocean Cleanup, which is tackling a really important planet-wide problem by removing plastic debris from our oceans and rivers.  They are harnessing the power of AI to protect marine life and ecosystems while also preventing microplastics from entering our food chain.


[![Thumbnail 340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=340)

Their AI system is able to optimize plastic detection models, predict debris movement patterns, and maximize the efficiency of their cleanup operations so that they can operate in the most impactful locations around the globe. Or the Island Institute that's developing an advanced neural  net model for analyzing single cell, multi-modal brain cell data in hopes to unlock groundbreaking new therapies. 

[![Thumbnail 350](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/350.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=350)



But the reality is, building and scaling these amazing agentic AI systems are harder than the problems they are  trying to solve. So let's start by looking at the tools, protocols, and frameworks that make it easy for you to build reliable, accurate, and scalable agentic AI systems end  to end. But first, let's take a look at what is an agent. 

[![Thumbnail 380](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/380.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=380)


### Understanding Agents: Beyond Chatbots to Autonomous Action

Agents are those that can sense and interact with the digital environment, and they can convert high level objectives into series of executable steps. And they constantly learn and  improve their efficiency over time. But many of you might be wondering, how is an agent different from a Generative AI chatbot? 



[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=430)

Now imagine that over the course of the last few days, the traffic to your website decreased by 40%. Now, if you were to ask a chatbot saying why did my traffic go down?  It would respond something similar to this, saying that's really concerning. You should check your analytics to see which pages were affected. And of course, review any recent changes and look at your server logs and so forth. Really nice helpful advice, but not at all useful. But then an agent on the other hand, will pull analytics data to identify  affected pages. They query your deployment system for recent code changes. They scan the server error logs. And then  once it identifies the issues, it will create a bug ticket with the problem and the affected code, and even provide a fix for the engineering team to review and deploy. In effect, the chatbot tells you what to investigate, whereas the agent investigates, diagnoses the problem, and initiates the solution.


[![Thumbnail 480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=480)


Today, agents are transforming industries from software development to drug research, from precision  agriculture to architectural design. Their ability to use and manipulate interfaces the same way we as humans do, is fundamentally changing how we build applications, dramatically lowering the technical barriers to creating powerful, useful solutions. Now, at their core, every agent is  built from three important components. The first is a model that serves as the brain of an agent responsible for reasoning, planning, and execution. Second, the code that identifies or defines the agent's identity. It establishes its capabilities and guides through the decision making process. And then the third is the tools. These are the things that bring agents to life, whether they are the Backend APIs or access to knowledge base and databases, code interpreters, or web browsers that enable real world  action. The true power lies in how you orchestrate all these components together.



[![Thumbnail 570](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/570.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=570)

### Introducing Strands Agents SDK: Simplifying Agent Development

Historically, wiring these AI  components together was a really labor intensive and brittle process. Yes, frameworks help, but they still demand a deep expertise. Developers found themselves hard coding complex decision trees. These are the intricate state machines with rigid, predefined workflows for every  conceivable scenario. This created mountains of boilerplate code that was not only difficult to maintain, but nearly impossible to adapt in a dynamic world. Because models couldn't reliably reason about the next step, developers had to manually orchestrate every single tool call and state  transition. And when something unexpected happened, and it always did, agents would often fail.



But then, as models  became more sophisticated and gained true reasoning capabilities, everything changed. When errors occurred or there was ambiguity, the model didn't just fail, it could  reason through the alternatives. We didn't need static orchestration anymore in this new world. We believed how you build agents should be really simple, where the agent autonomously plans its actions, they chain to all the tools.

[![Thumbnail 630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=630)



They adapt in real time to unexpected situations. The developers simply define these components: the model, the code, and the tools. This is what inspired our teams to build the Strands Agents SDK.  As our teams started building agents for our own products, we took a step back to rethink what the agent SDK of the future would look like—one that enables developers to create agents with minimal code. Strands embraces a model-driven approach where modern LLMs can autonomously handle any scenario an agent might face.  This eliminates the need for all these predefined workflows and complex orchestration code, while also improving agent accuracy and code maintenance. 

Strands really delivered. We eliminated thousands of lines of code across our agent systems while improving agent accuracy and code maintenance. Realizing its potential, we open-sourced Strands so we could empower every developer to build their own agents. Since launching in preview in May, we have worked tirelessly with the community to add new features and capabilities. We have hundreds of community contributions helping add features such as new model providers, A2A support, and multi-agent hooks so you can build more robust and extensible agents.

[![Thumbnail 710](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/710.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=710)

This week, today, we are adding two new exciting capabilities.  The first is support for TypeScript, extending Strands to one of the world's most popular programming languages. The second is support for edge devices. You should check out the Cool Robotics demo where they are unlocking new agent capabilities in automotive, gaming, and robotics, enabling autonomous AI agents to run at the edge.

[![Thumbnail 750](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/750.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=750)

[![Thumbnail 780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=780)


Developers across every industry are loving the simplicity and extensibility of Strands Agents. It is no surprise that in just a period of very few months, Strands has been downloaded more than 5 million times.  Today, we live in a world where almost every developer is starting to experiment and build AI agents on their laptops. With all this activity and so many proof of concepts happening now, leaders are asking why they cannot see all these amazing agents running in production.  The problem is that most experiments and proof of concepts are not designed to be production ready.  We need to close this gap and break out of this proof of concept jail.


### Breaking Out of POC Jail with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

The first thing you need to get to production faster is the ability to rapidly deploy agents at scale. This means having the infrastructure that can rapidly go from zero to thousands of concurrent sessions and the ability to support all these long-running agents with the right session isolation that can stop sensitive data from being shared with other agents. 

[![Thumbnail 870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=870)

Next, your agents must navigate massive amounts of data and edge cases to get to production. Your agents need sophisticated memory systems that can manage context within conversations and interactions and remember user preferences across sessions.  Then comes the challenge of identity and access management. Without proper security controls, agents can inadvertently access or expose sensitive data that they should not in production. You need rock-solid identity and access management to authenticate users and authorize which tools agents can access on their behalf and manage these credentials across AWS and third-party services.

[![Thumbnail 890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=890)

[![Thumbnail 900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=900)

As you move to production, your agent is not going to live in isolation.  It will be part of a wider system that cannot fall apart if an integration breaks. So you need seamless tool connectivity that enables agents to securely integrate with APIs, databases, and services that your application needs. Finally, you need the ability to observe and quickly debug issues as they arise because you simply cannot fix what you cannot see.  POCs are never designed with these requirements in mind, and most off-the-shelf solutions are not equipped to handle all these challenges effectively.

[![Thumbnail 930](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/930.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=930)


They are rigid and they lack modularity, so you end up building custom logic that tapes all these solutions together, adding unnecessary complexity that turns your really cool prototype into a maintenance nightmare that slows down innovation. That's why we built Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.  It's the most advanced agent platform to build, deploy, and operate agents securely at scale. It's like having a toolbox, but every tool is built for the problems that you will deal with while building and operating agents. 



People love it because it works with any agent framework and any model, giving you the freedom to use the tools that work best for your use case.  It's modular so that you can mix and match using just the pieces you need for your solution. AgentCore does the heavy lifting so you can focus on what matters most: creating these breakthrough experiences that solve real world business problems. 


[![Thumbnail 1010](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1010.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1010)

Now let me show you the difference this makes in practice. Take the example of identity and access management, one of the notorious time sinks that can derail any project. With AgentCore identity, you get seamless identity and access management across AWS apps and third party apps like Slack and Zoom, all in just a few lines of code.  Now imagine building the same capability from scratch. Picture weeks of authentication flow, security protocols, API integration, and endless edge cases.  Which one would you rather write and maintain?



[![Thumbnail 1040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1040)

### Cox Automotive's Transformation: Building Agents at Hyperdrive Speed

The ease of agent building that comes from using AgentCore and Strands is already helping customers transform their business.  Take Cox Automotive, for example. They have reinvented how they build and deploy agents across their entire organization.  Let's see their story. 

[![Thumbnail 1050](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1050.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1050)

If you think about running a dealership or an auto manufacturer, those have back office processes that are often manual and cumbersome.  At Cox Automotive, we are in hyperdrive, moving aggressively towards disruptive positive value to change the game, change how you shop for a car, change how you sell a car, and change how you service a car, while helping our customers level up their own operations in ways they never thought possible.

[![Thumbnail 1080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1080)


We also took an internal use case with an agentic solution that we call Fleet Mate. Something that actually took two days per estimator, we got that down to less than thirty minutes per vehicle. AWS really shows up as a true partner.  AgentCore has allowed us to move fast, building agents and allowing agents to work with other agents. They are allowing us to be inside the product roadmap and help shape what we need in order to innovate at the speed that our customers are expecting us to. 

Bringing agents to life allowed us to work across our different areas of business and find opportunities where we could bring agentic thinking into a workflow and drive value. One of the most exciting things about our story is seeing an engineer using tools like AgentCore, Strands, and Bedrock and building agentic solutions. Their mind gets blown. They can go from not knowing the tool, not knowing how to use it, and producing something in days, sometimes hours, things they never thought were possible. That is super exciting to see.



[![Thumbnail 1170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1170)

Wow, it's exciting to see how Cox's transformation is opening a world of possibilities.  It's stories like these that fuel our innovation engine. Just yesterday, Matt unveiled two new capabilities that came directly from your feedback.  AgentCore Policy provides control over agent interactions and behavior while giving agents the freedom to reason and take the best action to fulfill a request so that you can build trusted agent capabilities. AgentCore Evaluations enables evaluating and testing agents in thousands of simulated scenarios before they meet your customers.  So no longer do you have to cross your fingers and hope for the best when you launch an agent.

[![Thumbnail 1200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1200.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1200)

### Episodic Memory: Teaching Agents to Remember and Learn

But today, I want to explore something that gets to the heart of what makes agents truly intelligent: memory. Think about the experience at your favorite local restaurant. What made it exceptional? It's because they remembered you. They know your name, they know your seating preferences, and they know your favorite meal.  In the agentic world, we have short term memory handling the immediate conversational flow and long term memory capturing the insights across sessions.

[![Thumbnail 1220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1220)

But something was missing: the when and the why behind user behavior. For example, picture this. You're rushing to catch a flight for work as a solo traveler. I travel carry-on only, and I like to be the last one on the plane. That means my travel agent books my ride 45 minutes before departure with all my TSA PreCheck and Clear, and whatever else will come, I will do it with perfect timing. 


[![Thumbnail 1260](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1260.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1260)

But then three months later, this time I'm wrangling a four-year-old and a ten-year-old, plus enough luggage with my wife for a small army.  My agent needs to remember the chaotic family trip from last summer. It needs to recognize the pattern and automatically book my ride to arrive at the airport at least two hours early.  Because traveling with kids changes everything. So what you need is not just the memory of the past, but also the context of the current interaction.

[![Thumbnail 1300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1300)

That's why we launched Episodic Memory, a new functionality with AgentCore long-term memory, so that agents can remember and learn from past experiences.  This new feature gives the ability to build agents that truly understand user behavior and adapt automatically by recognizing patterns across similar situations. They proactively offer solutions that work. It enables agents to store and recall specific experiences or interactions as discrete episodes, similar to how we remember particular events in our lives. The more your agents experience, the smarter they become.

[![Thumbnail 1330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1330)


### Customer Success Stories: Heroku, PGA TOUR, and Caylent

Now let's look at how customers are unlocking the freedom to innovate with AgentCore.  Heroku helps companies build and deploy apps in the cloud with their AI as a platform service. They use AgentCore to build Heroku, enabling anybody to build and run entire web apps using natural language with AgentCore runtime. They were able to speed up their development velocity and went from proof of concept to launch in just five weeks. 

[![Thumbnail 1390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1390)

The PGA TOUR, a pioneer in innovation and leader in sports, has built a multi-agent content generation system to create articles for their digital platform. That new solution built on AgentCore enables the PGA TOUR to provide comprehensive coverage for every player in the field by increasing content writing speed by 1,000 percent while also achieving a 95 percent reduction in cost.  Caylent, a next-generation cloud services company that helps companies build and scale their cloud journey, rebuilt on AgentCore. Caylent deleted thousands of lines of custom orchestration code, routing, and memory and replaced it with a managed serverless agent platform that just works.

[![Thumbnail 1430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1430)

Now they are shipping new integrations in days instead of weeks, and they cut their ops overhead by 70 percent and unlocked new capabilities like HR workflows and multi-turn agent reasoning that simply weren't possible on their custom-built system.  Next, I would like to invite William Brennan, VP of Tech Transformation at Blue Origin, to explain how they are leveraging AWS for their AI-powered space exploration.



[![Thumbnail 1480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1480)

### Blue Origin: Building the Road to Space with Agentic AI

Good morning everybody. At Blue Origin, we're building the road to space for the benefit of Earth.  In pop culture, space explorers have always had AI partners. Just think of some of those famous explorer duos from your childhood.  The farm boy and his droids, the starship captain and his voice-activated ship's computer, and yes, even the mission commander whose AI went rogue. We've long dreamed of a world where artificial intelligence and space exploration go together. From rockets to AI at Blue Origin, we're not dreaming of the future anymore. We're building it. 

[![Thumbnail 1500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1500.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1500)

This isn't new for us. Our New Shepard rocket became the first spaceship to autonomously launch and land vertically, making automation and reusability safe and reliable partners. Since then, 86 humans have trusted their lives to New Shepard's automation across 15 flights, experiencing a view of Earth they've always dreamed of.  The road to space grew visibly and powerfully, and last month, successful launch and landing of our New Glenn orbital rocket.


This next frontier includes an increased launch cadence, lunar landers, and a permanent presence on the moon. We're building on that automation and extending it using the latest innovations in AI. Our mission to reduce the cost of access to space is accelerated through agentic AI that learns, adapts, makes decisions, reasons, plans, and explains its thinking. That's why I think I literally have the coolest job in the world. We're going back to the  moon this time to stay, and agentic AI is one of our new teammates, helping us get there faster and cheaper.

[![Thumbnail 1550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1550)





Across Blue Origin, the road to space is being built by incredibly talented  and creative people in engineering, manufacturing, software, and supply chain. As a vertically integrated company, we run the full life cycle of a space mission from concept to  operations. Building and launching rockets requires tremendous specialization from dozens of these disciplines, and that practical knowledge isn't found in general  Large Language Models. It's buried in our systems, databases, and tribal knowledge. Agentic AI is the ability to create teams of domain expert agents with access to specific knowledge  and custom tools. This has completely transformed the application of AI at Blue Origin, taking a democratized approach to AI where everyone at Blue is expected to build and collaborate with AI  agents to do their work better and faster.



[![Thumbnail 1620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1620)

By equipping our teams with knowledgeable and capable agents, we were able to dramatically accelerate the product life cycle, increase  production rate, and most importantly, reduce the cost of access to space. The starting point for our builders and creators is our internal Generative AI platform we call  BlueGPT. It's a secure LLM and MCP gateway agent marketplace and multi-agent  orchestration system built on core AWS primitives: Bedrock, Strands Agents SDK, EKS, OpenSearch, RDS, and Lambda. This gives our agents access to all leading models, custom Knowledge Bases, and dozens of tools.

Agentic AI has exploded at Blue Origin through organic, disruptive adoption. Over 2,700  agents have been created and are in use in production in the agent marketplace, driving over 3.5 million interactions across  70% of our employees in the last month. There are so many examples I could give on how Team Blue is using agents to work better and faster. Ninety-five percent of our software engineers are  using agents to write code. New Glenn is using agents to accelerate launch approvals. Supply chain and manufacturing use agents for design changes and work orders. But what I  really want to talk about are Tearex systems.


Not space dinosaurs, but rather an innovative project at Blue Origin, Tearex stands for Thermal Energy Advanced Regolith Extraction, and it's a brand new capability being developed by our In Space Exploration Systems group to solve one of the toughest challenges: surviving the lunar night, equivalent to 14 Earth days of freezing darkness. I have part of it right here with me, and this thing is  amazing. As you can see in the video, the Tearex takes lunar regolith, or moon dust, from the surface of the moon, circulates it through this chamber, and then extracts the heat through a lightweight heat exchanger, and then runs it through this cylinder to save the rest of the machine from the sensitive and abrasive rocks.


[![Thumbnail 1740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1740.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1740)


Designed to run for years, this heat cycle is then reversed during the lunar day to recharge regolith for use during the next night, turning moon dust into a battery. While  Tearex is amazing, what's even more amazing is the team of AI agents that helped build it. A BlueGPT agent helped us with  the detailed requirements. Another agent helped us create the system architecture. One of my favorite agents is our simulation and analysis agent, where we're able to  automate the iterative design loops, rapidly improving the product with custom Knowledge Bases and connected to AI-native tools like Ntop for mass and performance optimization and Asteroid Digital for deterministic validation and artifact management.


The agents run complex physics simulations, iterate on the design based on the results, and execute until the requirements are met, all running on GPU-accelerated EC2. Tearex is a great example of what we see as the future of engineering teams at Blue Origin: small teams of experts working  with large teams of AI agents to deliver the work of tens of thousands at orders of magnitude faster than before. The benefits are immense. Using agents, our engineers were able to deliver a performant product over 75% faster than traditional approaches, with mass 40% improved over the original designs.

Now I get it. Most of  you aren't building rockets or lunar infrastructure, but you do deal with specialized knowledge and custom tools, and I think you could benefit from a few of our learnings.

[![Thumbnail 1830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1830)

First, I'd encourage you to think of adoption of AI as everyone's job, not just the technology teams. Democratizing agent creation with a simple, user-friendly interface led to 70% company adoption. Second, I encourage you to let the process for innovation be messy, but discovery easy. A public  marketplace or agent app store has really helped us here, providing easy-to-use evaluation tools to allow your teams to test and discover their agents.



[![Thumbnail 1860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1860)


Third, let AWS handle the LLM  agent primitives and scaling, and focus on building with those tools to solve problems for yourselves and for your  customers. With agentic AI, we believe that the future is now. It's just not evenly distributed. We aren't yet developing all of our products using AI, but we will be. With  millions of people living and working in space, we believe in a world where agentic AI can design an entire rocket, where we can launch 100 rockets with one person, rather than one  rocket with 100 people.

[![Thumbnail 1880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1880)



Our work with AWS isn't slowing down. We are building an enterprise knowledge graph on AgentCore, transforming the AI accessibility of all of our  data. And we're excited to test some of our own custom-built models with our autonomous lunar rover on the moon trained on AWS GPUs. Our talented team of Blue Origin employees and AI  agents will continue to be the fuel for this rapid innovation as we build the road to space for the benefit of Earth. Thank  you very much.


[![Thumbnail 1930](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1930.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1930)

### Model Efficiency Through Supervised Fine-Tuning

It's fascinating to see how customers are leveraging agents  even in space exploration. Now, as agents become easier to build, the next big question emerges: how do we make them more efficient? Today's off-the-shelf models have broad  intelligence. They can handle complex tool use, multi-step reasoning, and unexpected situations, but they aren't always the most efficient.

[![Thumbnail 1950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/1950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=1950)


This efficiency is not just about cost; it's about latency. How quickly can your agent respond? It's about scale. Can it handle peak demand? It's  about agility. Can you iterate and improve quickly? These are the practical realities of deploying AI at scale. So how  do we address these challenges? The majority of agents spend most of their time on routine operations. These are like writing code, analyzing search results, creating content, and executing predefined workflows.

If we know these tasks upfront, we can customize models specifically for them. Model customization enables us to build agents that are efficient to deploy at scale while achieving the right performance. So the question isn't whether you should customize your models, but how quickly can you get started? Now let's explore the techniques available and how we can help you turn this vision into reality.

The first technique we will look at is supervised fine-tuning. Think of it as teaching your AI agent to be a specialist instead of a generalist, like turning your family doctor into a cardiologist who is laser-focused on exactly what you need. This is where most teams start, and for really good reason. It's practical. You don't need massive compute budgets or a Ph.D. in Machine Learning to get started.

[![Thumbnail 2040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2040)

You start with a pre-trained model and train it on curated agent-specific datasets containing tool use patterns, multi-step reasoning traces, and  successful task completion. This creates permanent behavior changes and they don't require lengthy prompts and can dramatically improve performance on specific tasks where the base model struggles. But here is the catch: your model can get so focused on specific tasks due to overtraining that it might lose those amazing capabilities that made you choose the big model in the first place.


So the key  to success here is quality over quantity. A dataset with 10,000 carefully curated agent interactions will outperform millions of generic examples. Think of it this way: would you rather learn surgery from 10,000 recordings of world-class surgeons performing your exact procedure, or from millions of random YouTube videos? The choice is obvious.

### Advanced Customization: Model Distillation and Reinforcement Learning

The next technique is model distillation. You should use model distillation when you have deployment constraints like memory limitations, and you need to deploy a smaller model.


[![Thumbnail 2120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2120)


Think of this method as creating a brilliant apprentice who learns from a master craftsman, but they can work twice as fast with half the tools.  You take a large, powerful teacher model and train a much smaller student model to mimic not just the answer, but also how they think through and reason.  The student learns entire confidence levels, decision patterns, and even recognition strategies.  Here we often see up to ten times speedup with models retaining 95 to 98 percent of the teacher's performance. That's the difference between a three second latency for customer calls versus getting an almost instant response.


[![Thumbnail 2180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2180)

The trade-off is that you need that high performing teacher model, and distillation requires substantial compute resources.  But once you get that efficient digital model, it pays dividends with every deployment. Then there is reinforcement learning, where models learn from the outcomes of their actions by getting rewards for good outcomes and penalties for bad ones.  There are two flavors of reinforcement learning: reinforcement learning from human feedback and reinforcement learning from AI feedback.


With human feedback, you show people multiple AI responses to the same customer inquiry and ask them to rank from best to worst. You use these rankings to train a reward model that learns to think like these human evaluators, becoming your automated quality scorer. Your agent executes an action, and then the reward model gives it a gold star or says it's bad, try again.  The agent learns through trial and error, just like we do. This approach shines when outcomes are impossible to define programmatically. How do you code up a sound, empathetic but professional response? You simply can't, but humans know it when they see it, and now your model can learn to recognize it too.

[![Thumbnail 2240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2240.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2240)

In reinforcement learning with AI feedback, instead of human rankings, you use a powerful large language model to evaluate and rank these responses.  This is much faster, much cheaper, and more consistent than humans. It's perfect for outcomes with clear right or wrong answers, and lets you scale to millions of examples. It also rewards good processes, not just the answers. The model learns to think strategically step by step, which is exactly what agents need.



When an agent is troubleshooting a complex issue, you don't just want the final answer.  You want the logical diagnostic steps, the right clarifying questions, and methodical problem solving. That is strategic thinking, and that's what reinforcement learning teaches. While reinforcement learning is incredibly powerful, implementation of reinforcement learning techniques can be a challenge.  You need PhD level expertise in reward modeling, policy optimization, and integrating feedback. Then there is setting up complex distributed infrastructure and spending months in development with no guarantee it is ever going to work.

[![Thumbnail 2310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2310)

### Democratizing Advanced Training with Reinforcement Fine-tuning in Bedrock

The cost involves six to twelve month projects running on high end compute resources, and most companies simply can't afford it.  So you have to compromise. You either settle for the generic models with poor performance, or you spend millions customizing models with reinforcement learning. And then when your workload patterns change, you start this entire expensive process all over again. So we thought, what if we could take away all the complexity and cost while still giving you access to these advanced training techniques?


[![Thumbnail 2380](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2380.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2380)

That's why today we are making Reinforcement Fine-tuning available in Amazon Bedrock.  Reinforcement Fine-tuning helps customers improve model accuracy without needing deep machine learning expertise or large sums of labeled data. Bedrock automates the entire Reinforcement Fine-tuning workflow by making this advanced model customization technique accessible to everyday developers. You can start today with Amazon Nova, and we will be starting support for open model weights really soon.  Here's how it works very simply. You start by selecting the base model you want to modify, point it at your Bedrock logs and select a reward function, the easiest of which is an LLM based judge. And that's it. Behind the scenes, Bedrock handles all the complexity of reinforcement learning implementation, striking the right balance of customization and ease of use for most use cases.


[![Thumbnail 2440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2440)

It delivers 66% accuracy gains on average over base models.  That is how powerful these techniques are now. While Bedrock offers an easy and powerful way to fine-tune models, there are many more customers that want full control over their customization techniques and want to leverage their data.  Think about a legal firm. Their competitive advantage is their accumulated knowledge base and reasoning patterns. Training a model from scratch ensures this proprietary expertise remains confidential while also giving them a competitive advantage. A healthcare provider needs models trained on their specific patient outcomes, not just generic medical data. That is exactly why we built SageMaker AI.

[![Thumbnail 2490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2490)



SageMaker AI gives you everything you need to build, train, and deploy AI models that are uniquely yours at whatever scale. It supports knowledge distillation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. You can do full weight training or parameter-efficient fine-tuning, whatever your use case demands. SageMaker AI includes IDE and MLOps capabilities.  You can go from idea to production in weeks, not months. Now, customers like Dhan India built a large language model that deeply understands the complexities of the Indian financial market.  They started with Mistral-7B as the base model. They built IAM, a specialized seven billion parameter model, using a combination of training methods like continual pre-training, fine-tuning, and knowledge distillation.  Their solution used Amazon SageMaker for the model building and training, and used Bedrock for the teacher model support.

[![Thumbnail 2550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2550)


### SageMaker AI: From Months to Days with Serverless Model Customization

The new customized model runs on a single GPU infrastructure and outperforms state-of-the-art models 88% of the time while providing better performance at a fraction of the operational cost. However, the very flexibility that makes SageMaker AI so capable also means that you must navigate numerous decisions and technical hurdles to achieve your goals.  Think about what you are actually signing up for when you want to customize a model with your data.  First, you are defining the goals and picking evaluation criteria. Are you optimizing for accuracy, latency, or cost? Then you are choosing fine-tuning, RAG, or maybe pre-training from scratch. Then comes the challenging part: data preparation.


[![Thumbnail 2600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2600)

You are cleaning datasets, checking for biases, and making sure everything is properly formatted. Anyone who has done this knows it is never as clean as you hope it will be.  Then you are spinning up infrastructure, configuring training jobs, watching loss curves, and tweaking all these hyperparameters.  When something breaks at 2 a.m., guess who is getting that alert? Finally, after weeks of work, you have a model. But wait, now you need to evaluate it and optimize it for production, making sure it meets your company's AI governance standards. What should be a really exciting AI project turns into months of laborious, challenging work before you see any business value.

[![Thumbnail 2660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2660.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2660)


What if we could compress that journey from months down to just days? That is why today I am thrilled to announce the release of new serverless model customization capabilities in SageMaker AI.  With this release, you can customize popular models such as Amazon Nova, Qwen, Llama, and Deepseek and deploy them directly on Bedrock or SageMaker in just a few steps. Better yet, this concept offers experiences where you can choose the right approach based on your comfort level.  There is a self-guided approach for those who like to be in the driver's seat, and an agent-driven experience that uses an AI expert for folks who like to turn on autopilot in their cars. Each of these paths provides you access to new reinforcement learning techniques like RLAI, RLVR, and DPO, and are based on the best model for the job, either your choice or the agent's choice.

[![Thumbnail 2700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2700)

Now the agentic AI experience launching in preview removes the heavy lifting so that you can focus on the outcome.  You use natural language to explain your use case, and the AI agent guides you through the full customization workflow.



[![Thumbnail 2730](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2730.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2730)


First, the system analyzes your scenario to recommend the right fine-tuning  technique. Then, if needed, it will generate the synthetic dataset for your model customization. And then it sets up the entire serverless infrastructure to train the model without any  manual intervention. Finally, it evaluates the trained model against the base model to determine if the  customization was successful. What used to take many ML engineers and months of trial and error now happens in  just days, all guided by an agent that knows the best practices and does the heavy lifting for you.



### Building Custom Foundation Models with Amazon Nova Forge and HyperPod

While these model customization techniques enable you to build  agents that are efficient to deploy at scale, working closely with customers helped us identify another key gap. Traditional techniques cannot deliver the domain-specific intelligence, accuracy, and price performance that  competitive applications need, especially when you need models that deeply understand your industry data and workflows. For example, a drug discovery company needs an AI model that deeply understands molecular structures, protein interactions, and clinical data specific to their therapeutic area. Generic models lack this specialized knowledge, and fine-tuning simply cannot embed the foundational understanding of their proprietary research.

[![Thumbnail 2800](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2800.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2800)


Many of you might ask why you cannot use any of the customization techniques we talked about earlier. The simple answer is that these techniques add knowledge on top of a model that was not designed for that domain. It is the difference between teaching a general translator some medical terms versus training a medical translator from the beginning.  This means that today, if you want to truly customize foundational models, you end up starting from scratch. You need  millions of dollars in compute, months of training time, and specialized ML experts, and you have to manage massive infrastructure. You are starting from zero with no proven baseline or guarantee of success.

[![Thumbnail 2890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2890)

This is why custom foundational models have been the exclusive domain of well-funded organizations and AI startups. But now with Amazon Nova Forge, which Matt launched yesterday, you have a first-of-its-kind program that offers you the easiest and most cost-effective way to build your own frontier model. With Amazon Nova, you get access to intermediate checkpoints, and you can mix in your proprietary data with Amazon-curated data during the training cycle without having to worry about the compute, data, and time needed for full model training. The result is a model with frontier intelligence tailored to your industry and use case while retaining Nova's foundational knowledge, safety,  and reliability, all without the cost and effort of the full training lifecycle.

[![Thumbnail 2900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2900)


[![Thumbnail 2930](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2930.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2930)

Another area we are focused on  a lot is helping you build and run cost-effective and performant agentic infrastructure. This is where  SageMaker HyperPod comes in. HyperPod has transformed the traditional, complex, and time-consuming process of managing infrastructure for training and deploying models into a fully managed service. It removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting and scales across thousands of AI accelerators with automatic  workload prioritization, and reduces model development costs by up to 40%. Most critically, it gives you full visibility and control over how different tasks are prioritized and how compute resources are allocated to each task so that you can maximize these expensive resources.


[![Thumbnail 2970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/2970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=2970)


However, when you are building or training a model, it is not uncommon to have failures. As your models become bigger  and require even larger training clusters, the failures become even more frequent and take longer to resolve. To deal with these unexpected failures, HyperPod  automatically saves model snapshots or checkpoints, and when a failure occurs, it recovers from a previously saved checkpoint. But this traditional checkpoint-based recovery is not always easy. You have to pause the entire cluster and then diagnose the issue, and then restore from  the saved checkpoints, all the while leaving expensive AI resources idle for hours, keeping your CFO up at night. So we thought, what if we could find a way to improve training resiliency and reduce downtime? That is why today we are announcing Checkpointless Training on SageMaker HyperPod.

[![Thumbnail 3020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3020.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3020)

With this new feature, we significantly reduce the  recovery overhead since the process no longer requires rolling back a partial training step. This is a paradigm shift in model training that automatically recovers from infrastructure faults in minutes with zero manual intervention, even with clusters that span hundreds of thousands of AI accelerators. The way we achieve this is by continuously preserving the model state across the distributed cluster.


[![Thumbnail 3060](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3060.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3060)

[![Thumbnail 3080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3080)

So when something goes wrong,  there is no need to panic and rollback to some old checkpoint. Instead, it smoothly swaps out the faulty hardware and uses  peer-to-peer transfer to grab the exact model state from healthy accelerators nearby. So now you get faster recovery and significant cost savings in your model training. With all of these launches we have announced today, we are excited to give you the tools you need to build highly  efficient models.

[![Thumbnail 3090](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3090.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3090)


### Vercel's Vision: Self-Driving Infrastructure for the AI Era

Now let's hear from Guillermo Rauch, CEO and founder of Vercel, who has put these principles into  practice leveraging AWS to build efficient and scalable tools that deliver real value to millions of developers today. When I was growing up in Argentina, I would deconstruct sites on our family computer and bring my own ideas to life by typing a file to a server and sharing a link with my friends. It was the best feeling. I could just build and I never stopped  building.



[![Thumbnail 3170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3170)

I built with every tool and every framework, which eventually led me to create my own framework.  Next.js.  With Next.js, we made building high quality applications accessible to anyone from the biggest enterprises on the planet to solo developers starting out with just an idea. The problem was that even with Next.js, I built an app in a couple of hours and then spent weeks setting up infrastructure to get it out into the world. I didn't just want easy, I wanted peak performance at scale and I  wanted it now.

[![Thumbnail 3180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3180)


That idea led me to build Vercel. Ten years later, Vercel now empowers more than 11 million customers to  build, scale and secure global web applications without managing infrastructure. With more than 1 trillion requests served every month, now AI is changing what and how we build. Interfaces are becoming conversations and workflows are becoming autonomous. We're witnessing the shift from web pages to AI agents. This is perhaps the most important  transformation we'll see in our careers as developers and technologists.



This is how the Vercel AI Cloud was born to redefine fully managed infrastructure for the AI era. We call this self-driving infrastructure.  You write an app, you push your code, and automatically the best possible infrastructure is provisioned, orchestrated and optimized for you. Vercel operates as an always-on system that observes every input from the code you write, the code you ship to the traffic your users generate, and turns that data into real-time insights and optimizations. You get to focus on your  business, your products, your customers.

[![Thumbnail 3270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3270)


We know this works because we prove it at scale every day with our  customers, but also because we build Vercel on Vercel and Vercel is powered by AWS, which means with just one git push, you reap the benefits of fully self-driving AWS infrastructure. Let's look at this in action. First, v0. V0 is the realization of that original dream, the thing I wished existed when I was hacking together my websites in Argentina.  You speak your mind and in seconds you have a live working application.

[![Thumbnail 3320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3320)

v0 has been serving millions of requests per day since its launch.  This was possible because under the hood, v0 runs on Vercel, which runs on AWS with model inference provided by Amazon Bedrock. When we were building v0, our engineers could write code, deploy it over Vercel, and scale without configuring AWS primitives. This freed up the v0 team's time to focus on the novel AI challenges with new models, new ideas, and new techniques coming up every week.

 To keep up and move at the speed of AI, we built the AI SDK. Think of it as what Next.js did for building pages—the AI SDK does for building agents. We first built it for ourselves, and then we made it available for everyone. It makes AI simple, model agnostic, and scalable.  Today, the AI SDK is downloaded about 5 million times per week, and with the AI SDK, anyone can build with AI, whether it's your first AI app or you're at scale like Thomson Reuters.

[![Thumbnail 3400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3400)

 Thomson Reuters' co-counsel AI assistant serves attorneys, accountants, and audit teams. They used the AI SDK and Vercel, and a team of just three developers built their tax advisory agent in just two months. It's already in use by 1,300 accounting firms. Now they're migrating their entire codebase to the AI SDK, deprecating thousands of lines of code across ten providers and consolidating everything into one composable and scalable system. Three developers, two months, thousands of firms—this could be any of you.

 As we move from pages to agents and pixels to tokens, it's helpful to reuse lessons from the past. The web scaled thanks to CDNs, which increased speed and reliability. That's why we built the AI Gateway.  Think of it as a CDN of tokens. It routes inference automatically and adds failover and critical controls. The AI Gateway is built on the same global network that serves all of our customers across 20 regions,  close to your users and your AWS data.


[![Thumbnail 3490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3490)

This network runs on battle-tested AWS infrastructure, including Global Accelerator, Shield, S3, EC2, and more.  Here's the next challenge: AI is changing the profile of our workloads.  While traditional apps need to load in milliseconds, agents can think over minutes or even hours and soon days. Serverless has been great for scaling on demand, which we also need for agents, but it hasn't been so great for what we call idle time.


[![Thumbnail 3520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3520)



 That's what we built Fluid Compute for. It's compute optimized for AI powered by AWS. Fluid adapts to every workload, whether it's pages or agents. Your functions scale on demand, but crucially, you pay only for what you actually use—active CPU time.  This is fully self-driving compute infrastructure. Our AI Cloud goes beyond Vercel's own services, providing seamless access to even more AWS solutions like AgentCore, Kiro, and RDS.  

How we build the web is changing. You'll be working with agents like v0 and Kiro. These agents will be writing code using frameworks like Next.js and the AI SDK, and they'll deploy to self-driving infrastructure. This is the future of the web, powered by Vercel and backed by AWS.



### Neurosymbolic AI: Building Trust Through Automated Reasoning

Vercel is helping their end users build and run intelligent agents, but they are also helping their builders at Vercel enable  an entirely new developer ecosystem. Now, as we hand over more tasks to AI agents and ask them to act autonomously on our behalf, we need to be able to trust that they will perform things as expected. While most of us have spent our  entire careers building accurate and reliable systems, agents introduce a whole new set of challenges that require radical new approaches.


[![Thumbnail 3710](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3710.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3710)

At AWS, one of the first agents we built a couple of years ago was an early prototype for what is now Kiro CLI. We found that while it worked great, in some cases LLMs would hallucinate API calls. Of course, we cannot just say it is okay if it hallucinates. We got together and brought a bunch of our machine learning scientists, and we also reached out to our automated reasoning team to see if we  could solve this problem with what we now call Neurosymbolic AI. In effect, we are creating the yang to the LLM, so to speak. We have a special treat for you today. We brought Byron Cook from AWS, a distinguished scientist and the foremost authority in automated reasoning, to explain how we are leveraging automated reasoning across AWS to help our agents  be more trustworthy.

So let us start with a question: How much do you trust agents today? For example, do you trust that they will send money to the right place? Or do you trust that they will follow local laws when operating on your behalf? Giving an agent access to your credit card is like giving a teenager access to your credit card to use on the internet. Sure, they will probably get a lot done on your behalf, but you might end up owning a pony or a warehouse full of candy.

The challenge is that agents are based on Large Language Models, and Large Language Models hallucinate. They make mistakes in the face of complex rules or logic. Their reasoning contains logical errors. Imagine an agent is interpreting a ticket returns policy and making mistakes. Now we are giving away money where we should not. That is not the sort of agent we are going to keep in production for very long.

[![Thumbnail 3740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3740.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3740)




To make matters worse, LLMs can be tricked. Bad actors can craft inputs to trick LLMs, and it is actually not hard to do today. This is because most genetic systems are using statistical methods like LLM as a judge to enforce their guidelines. That will never work in situations where sensitive matters like trust, money, or human lives are at stake.    

[![Thumbnail 3830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3830)

When we do not trust agents, we tend to overcompensate. We introduce additional human oversight on every step. We hard code the steps that they will take. Both of these techniques reduce the creativity and autonomy that agents have, which is precisely the reason we are excited about agents in the first place. 


What we want is an easy way to specify our constraints on agents at the outset, giving agents as much freedom as possible while defining the envelope in which they can operate safely. We then want assurance that they will follow those constraints even when the constraints are subtle or complex.  The good news is that we have much of the technology we need for this purpose, and that is why Swami has asked me to come on stage today to tell you about my scientific discipline of automated reasoning and how we are applying it to agentic AI.

Automated reasoning is the search for and detailed checking of proofs in mathematical logic. It is the same type of reasoning performed by people like Euclid during the time of the ancient Greeks. In our context, we can reason about all possible executions of a computer program in the same way that Euclid reasoned about all possible right angle triangles when proving the Pythagorean theorem. We have come full circle in a sense, taking ideas from two thousand years ago and applying them to one of today's most vexing challenges.

[![Thumbnail 3910](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3910.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3910)

Consider a system  where we want to know that the data is encrypted before it's stored. We can encode that property into a logical formula using temporal logic, and then use techniques from mathematical logic to prove that this property is always true. Furthermore, we're using symbolic techniques and symbolic logic, which allows us to reason about all possible inputs to the system and all possible configurations that the system might reach during its execution.

[![Thumbnail 3950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/3950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=3950)



Within AWS, we've actually been using this technique for over a decade.  We've been reasoning about our internal AWS systems, such as our virtualization stack, our cryptography stack, our identity, and our networking. Externally, customers have direct access to tools from this discipline. IAM Access Analyzer, VPC Reachability Analyzer, and S3  block public access are all based on this technology. Outside of AWS, we see people using this approach in mission-critical systems, such as aerospace, railway switching, and industrial control systems—basically any place where failure is  unacceptable.



[![Thumbnail 4040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4040)

Now we're bringing that same technology to the world of agentic AI. This fusion of formal reasoning and Large Language Models is typically called Neurosymbolic AI, where the neuron represents the statistical methods we're using and the symbolic represents the symbolic formulae or symbolic logic we're using under the hood.  So how do we use automated reasoning with LLMs? One method is to use automated reasoning to verify the output. The output might be programs, instructions for agents, or Q&A pairs.  If the automated reasoning tool signs off on the answer from the large language model, we're good to go.  But if we find a problem, we can push back on the language model and it can try again. This creates a feedback cycle that gives us a proof.




[![Thumbnail 4110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4110)

Another method is to flip the equation around and train the language model on the output of automated reasoning.  For example, many model providers today use the Lean theorem prover to create unbounded amounts of well-reasoned and sound training data. DXC is an example of a model provider that trains using the Lean theorem prover. The third method is to embed an automated reasoning verifier deep inside an LLM inference infrastructure.  An example of this is called constraint solving. Imagine an LLM that's responding to a question like "What's the capital of France?"  and it's answering with a token like B. If we sidecar the formal reasoning representation next to the language model, we don't need to allow the language model to completely answer.  Instead, we can ask the representation during the inference state to check the answers with regards to the formal reasoning model, and then we can nudge the language model to answer with the letter P for Paris instead of B. In some sense, we're shifting the reasoning left into the inference infrastructure.

[![Thumbnail 4170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4170)

This summer, we launched Kiro, Amazon's new Agentic IDE.  With Kiro, developers can use natural language features to define entire applications or features within applications. What makes Kiro different is its specification-driven approach to software development. Specifications hold a very special place in my heart because they're really the foundation of automated reasoning. Specifications are how we define the behavioral properties that we want to prove or disprove of our systems. Inspired by the success of automated reasoning and specification in AWS, the Kiro team has brought the idea of specification into Kiro itself.


[![Thumbnail 4200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4200.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4200)

Imagine you're building a calculator app that needs to handle many different scenarios as well as potential error states. During the design phase, Kiro  might analyze the application and identify a set of acceptance criteria. For example, it might state that when an error occurs, the app will eventually display a clear  error message in the display area. Kiro can then convert this criteria into a specification.


[![Thumbnail 4240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4240.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4240)


We can use the  specification to guide the language model as it attempts to find the code to implement the application. Today in Kiro, you can also use that specification to generate tests that use the structure of the specification to drive the application into interesting spaces, helping us raise assurance that the program implements the specification correctly and also helping us pressure test the environment that it's going to operate in and our assumptions  about that environment. It's not escaped our notice that we can also use automated reasoning to prove the correctness of the program against the specification. 



[![Thumbnail 4290](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4290.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4290)

Another challenge in the generative development space is to keep up with the APIs that the code we're generating is  programming against. Take AWS for example. AWS is evolving faster than the model providers can update their models. One way we can solve this is to develop and maintain a formal model of the APIs and then reason about the programs that  are being synthesized by the tool and how they respect the APIs, so we can keep up to date. 

[![Thumbnail 4310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4310)

Finally, yesterday Matt mentioned policy and AgentCore. With policy you get real time deterministic and auditable controls over how your agents interact with outside tools and data. You can describe in natural language the actions you want to allow, and then we translate them into a formal representation called Cedar. Cedar is something we actually launched two years ago.  It's an open source authorization language. Its semantics are formalized in the Lean theorem prover, and then we've recently added an automated reasoning based analysis to allow you to reason about the semantics of your policies.


[![Thumbnail 4360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4360)

Let's look at an example. Imagine we're building an agent to help us troubleshoot issues in  production. What we'd like is for the agent to access production data and run diagnostics to help us figure out how to resolve issues. But what we don't want is for the agent to make changes in production until we've agreed on what those changes are. So we can use natural language to write the following policy: Block any agent from performing update operations on resources in the AWS production account. 

[![Thumbnail 4390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4390)

Under the hood, this type of constraint can then be automatically converted into a Cedar policy that we can run through, for example, automated reasoning to verify that it aligns with our various requirements. Those might come from sovereignty, privacy, availability, durability, security, and so on. This type of combination of sound formal reasoning capabilities together with agentic AI represents a game changer for making trustworthy agents. We're excited about this work and the projects that are underway,  and they're going to help you build generative systems that are not just powerful but also trustworthy and secure at any scale.



### Amazon Nova Act: Achieving 90% Reliability in Workflow Automation

While automated reasoning helps us build agents that are accurate, we also need them to be  reliable for everyday use. Reliability is the level of certainty with which a task gets completed  across multiple agentic AI runs. When it comes to agents, businesses need high reliability when automating their workflows. Today we see agents that get a task right once but struggle when you ask them to do it again, let alone over and over.



[![Thumbnail 4490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4490)

When we think about automation back to the early days of 2000, the challenge of automation was handled by Robotic Process Automation, or RPA. They were designed to fill the gap between legacy systems  and modern business needs by mimicking human workers. These products could log into applications and handle data entry, but they were limited in their flexibility and would break when they encountered UI variations or complex workflows. Then came LLMs. They could handle UI  variations and adapt to complexity far better than RPA did. They could navigate browsers and reason through problems to successfully automate workflows,  even across diverse interfaces. But the problem is orchestration. These models are so complex you need to build error handling and backtracing because unlike a traditional script where you know exactly what failed, whereas an LLM might keep going down a failed path for several weeks.

Before it recognizes an error. So for many businesses using these Large Language Models for large-scale computer use automation, it is simply too consuming and error-prone to be practical. What a business really needed to begin with was automation that was simple and reliable. So we asked ourselves, how can we make this easier? The answer was not just to train a better model. We needed a better model, of course, but that needs to be part of an end-to-end automation service tightly integrating Amazon Nova, Bedrock AgentCore. That is exactly what we built.


[![Thumbnail 4590](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4590.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4590)

Today, I am excited to announce the general availability of Amazon Nova Act.  Nova Act is a new service to build and manage fleets of agents for automating production UI workflows with high reliability, ease of implementation, and fastest time to value at any scale. It achieves 90% reliability in the enterprise workflow settings that it was trained to perform. So what makes Nova Act different? It is because it is made up of tightly integrated components that work together to deliver this.  The model is optimized to deliver the best outcomes for workflow automation. Here we started with the Nova 2 Lite model and then post-trained it to target common enterprise workflows.

So here the orchestrator sends screenshots of your browser to the model, and then it routes commands such as clicking and typing to the actuator. It is what enables Act to use a browser the same way a person would. And finally, the SDK is your entry point to Nova Act. It enables you to build browser automation agents using simple natural language commands, and they make it easy to break down highly complex workflows into straightforward tasks. This tight vertical integration across the orchestrator, model, actuators, and tools, along with the SDK, enables Act to be more reliable than off-the-shelf models and frameworks.

[![Thumbnail 4670](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4670.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4670)


Because today one of the problems is that many models are trained separately from the components that plan and execute these actions, and they can negatively impact reliability. For example, imagine you are building an agent to control a robot.   Training a model separately from the orchestrator and actuators is like growing a robot's brain in a jar and then putting it into the robot after the fact. Here we are training the brain together with the arms and the legs so that it comes out of the box knowing how to walk.


[![Thumbnail 4730](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4730.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4730)

To make this work, it required us to rethink how you train agents. The entire stack that the agent is trained on is consistent for both training and production, enabling us to perform end-to-end post-training that accounts for everything agents will interact with.  But this alone is not enough. How you train really matters. Historically, agents were trained with something we call imitation learning, where the agent learns by observing and mimicking expert behavior. This is where we started too. But the downside of imitation learning is that the agent never learns to understand the cause and effect of its actions. 


[![Thumbnail 4770](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4770.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4770)

So that is why we trained Nova Act differently. For that, we turn to reinforcement learning, one of the customization techniques I talked about earlier. And we focus training on workflows that enterprises encounter frequently, such as completing hardware requests, automating workflows, and updating customer records in a CRM.  But the basis of reinforcement learning is allowing the agents to try workflows in an environment that enables them to learn from the outcomes of their actions. So to do that, we created reinforcement learning gyms  where these models could train and improve, just like when you go to the gym to work out.

[![Thumbnail 4790](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4790.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4790)

The RL gyms we created replicate real enterprise environments where agents can take actions and learn from their outcomes without interfering with their production environments.  In an enterprise, anything you use that has a browser or UI interface could be a gym. For instance, your CRM, your HR system, task trackers, or issue management system. In the gym, the agent is given a task or a workflow to solve and through trial and error, learns to solve it.

[![Thumbnail 4810](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4810.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4810)


We built  hundreds of gyms and had agents run thousands of workflows on each of them in parallel.  For each successful task completion, Nova Act got a reward, and for each failure it got a penalty. Over hundreds of thousands of these interactions, these gyms helped Nova learn patterns so it could reliably solve real world enterprise use cases.

[![Thumbnail 4840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4840)



All of this has enabled us to create a better service and a more intelligent model.  In key benchmarks like RealBench and ScreenSpot, we see Nova Act performing really well, as well as or better than some of the best models in this space. We are already seeing customers transform their businesses and workflows  with the high reliability of Nova Act. If you're interested in seeing how it performs in action, check out the Nova Act Playground or install the Nova Act IDE  extension in VS Code or other supported editors.



[![Thumbnail 4900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4900)

### The Future of Work: Agentic Teammates and the Freedom to Create Without Limits

The future of agentic AI is in agents that can do anything.  It's agents we can rely on to do everything. I truly believe AI agents mark one of the most transformative steps of our time, and AWS is  the best place to build and run these agents. We offer you the best tools and SDK to quickly and effortlessly go from idea  to production with AgentCore and Strands.



We provide the easiest path to customizing and fine-tuning models with Bedrock, SageMaker, and Nova Forge, so you can maximize the efficiency of these agents. We deeply invest in innovative techniques like automated reasoning and reinforcement learning, so that  you can meet the high accuracy and reliability needed for these modern workflows. When all of these things come together, the way we work is  changing. We are moving from automation of individual tasks to collaboration that accelerates entire industries.


[![Thumbnail 4970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/4970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=4970)

Yesterday, we announced three powerful new Frontier Agents.  These agents are autonomous, massively scalable, and they are persistent, able to work for hours or days in pursuit of their goals without requiring intervention or direction. Each one is purpose-built to work alongside teams of people.  First is the Kiro autonomous agent that works alongside developers to resolve backlogs, triage bugs, and improve code coverage.

Then we have the AWS Security Agent that helps you build apps that are secure from the start. It brings deep security expertise to review design documents and scan code for vulnerabilities. It accelerates penetration testing and provides tailored guidance based on your company's unique security policies. And then we have the AWS DevOps Agent, which integrates with observability tools like CloudWatch, Dynatrace, Datadog, New Relic, Splunk, and many more.



[![Thumbnail 5050](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/5050.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=5050)

It integrates with your runbooks, code repositories, and CI/CD pipelines so that it can engage as your on-call assistant to triage issues and also prevent them by being proactive. These Frontier Agents work with higher levels of autonomy and persistence, and in doing so are able to work alongside us. Another example of these agent teammates is Amazon QuickSight,  where AI agents work alongside business users to do research on your behalf and to find  business insights and automate routine tasks with workflows and create multi-agent workflows, all without ever  needing to write a single line of code.





Our vision for the future of work is that every person in an organization has intelligent agent teammates that amplify their capability and eliminate all the tedious tasks so that they can focus on the work they love the most and unlock insights that drive real business transformation.  To share more of what we are doing in this area, I'm excited to welcome Colleen Aubrey, our SVP  of applied AI solutions. Thank you Swami. I believe that over the next few years, agentic teammates will be  essential to every team. As essential as the people sitting right next to you. They will fundamentally transform how  companies build and deliver for their customers.


At the heart of this transformation is AI woven into daily operations, embedded in every workflow and as natural as checking your phone in the morning. But when do we pull the trigger? Do you  wait until every question about AI is answered, every risk mapped out, every unknown eliminated? That's the trap, isn't it? We convince ourselves that clarity equals confidence, that predictability equals efficiency.

[![Thumbnail 5170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/5170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=5170)

But luckily, here's what I've learned building at Amazon: transformation and agility are not opposites. They're actually partners. Real efficiency isn't static. It's alive and it adapts. Making meaningful change is also not about automation. Automation assumes that the current approach is optimal,  that the ultimate prize is less effort. But many times the status quo is not optimal. The real prize of AI is new products, new services, better customer experiences, and new business models, not less effort.





But there's a journey  to get there, and we all know this is a journey that is accelerating. It's possible that the biggest limitation to transformative change is not a technical limitation. It's our  own ability to reimagine how we work, how we collaborate, and how we make AI part of the team. So what does it look like to  have an agentic teammate? One of the first places we've put agents to work as teammates is in Amazon Connect. Connect is an  easy-to-use, cloud-based, omnichannel AI-native customer service application. It's based on the same technology we use within Amazon to power our own customer service, and it's used around the world to power billions of customer conversations.


[![Thumbnail 5270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/5270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=5270)

Customers like DXC Technology, a global provider of IT and consulting services, help companies modernize their systems. They use Connect to intelligently determine which interactions to route to which people, and then empower those people with real-time assistance that pulls in from internal knowledge bases while respecting access and security controls.  This enables DXC to deliver very personalized, context-aware support across every channel. What we see across many customers is that the center of gravity for customer experience  is the same. It's starting in the contact center. But let's be clear: the contact center has expanded beyond just the interactions today. They're about the operational backbone for customer relationships, and the agentic capabilities of Amazon Connect are there to help through each challenge.

So let's see it in action. Many transactions involve bank or credit card or digital payment. As a cardholder, one of the  most concerning moments is when you see a transaction on your account that you just do not recognize. It can happen  to anyone, even me. Earlier today, I saw several transactions on my account that I didn't recognize. So let's call customer service and see if  they can help.



Good morning, Colleen. Before we get started, let me verify your identity. Can you tell me  your passphrase? Sure, it's "Show me the money." And can you tell me one of your recent transactions? Yeah, let me think. This morning, I got a cortado at Illy. Thanks, Colleen. I was able to verify your account. I see in your account notes you're traveling right now. Are you  having problems with your card? Yeah, so this morning, I saw several transactions that I just don't recognize them.



I'm sorry to hear that,  Colleen. Which transactions? There was a bunch at gas stations that I've never been to. But also, I'm not even driving while I'm here. Okay, I see them. I am  locking your cards so we can start an investigation. Whoa, whoa, wait. I'm at a conference. This is the only card I have with me. I need to use it while I'm here. Not to worry. I see you've added this card to Apple Pay. We will only block transactions with your physical card. So you can continue using tap to pay on your phone and registered devices. And I'll also expedite having a new card sent to your home address.


Okay, great. That works. But what about these transactions? How do they happen? Is there  some fraud going on? I'm taking a look now. I'll need to review the details to see if I can identify a pattern.

I'd like to connect you to my colleague. While I do this, I'll share what I find while they talk with you. Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this quickly.

Okay, great. Let's do that. Hi Colleen, I'm Hector. I'm the investigator assigned to your case. The agent gave me all your information. I thank God I thought I was going to have to repeat all of it. Nope, don't worry. Let me just say I'm so sorry this is happening to you, especially when you're at a big conference.

Thanks, Hector. So what happened? Are my other accounts at risk? Let me pull the transactions and take a look. Okay, that sounds great. 



[![Thumbnail 5510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/5510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=5510)


All right, analyzing and verifying fraudulent activity is a process that often takes hours or days. Using my teammate to help me, I'm going to do all of this in just a few minutes. So let's get started. All right, let's see this. I see the agent has already flagged the suspicious activity and analyzed them all. They found that the  geographic pattern of the transactions seems suspicious. Let's take a look at these transactions on a map. I can see these transactions happen all across the US, and as far as I know, Colleen can't teleport, so I agree this looks  super suspicious. The agent also tells me this pattern is inconsistent with normal travel. Let's see if we can  verify this by asking the agent to look for patterns across other cases. In just a few seconds, the agent was able to confirm likely fraud. As already suggested, our standard operating procedure for this type of activity is to create a police report and share the details. So I'll  go ahead and do that.

[![Thumbnail 5550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/5550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=5550)


Great, okay, so we handled the fraud. But that's one problem solved, and Colleen was also worried about the other problem. So let's check those out. I'll switch to Colleen to connect agents building experience so I can create custom agents that will be able to watch Colleen's  account for any suspicious activity. I just give the agent a name, type configuration template, and a quick description. I can define this behavior by providing a simple prompt. Next, I need to apply guardrails for the agent, and that's it. Let's get back to Colleen and tell her what we  did.


[![Thumbnail 5600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/5600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=5600)

All right Colleen, it looks like your card was most likely skimmed at an ATM you use at the airport. What? Really? Yeah, really. But I analyzed all your other accounts and good news—there's nothing abnormal. For extra peace of mind, I set up automatic health checks on all your accounts that will alert you via secure  message if anything suspicious does happen. Okay, great. Thanks. I travel a lot for work, and this is super frustrating. Is there anything we can do to stop this  going forward?

[![Thumbnail 5630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/5630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=5630)


Yes, super frustrating, but let me see what else I can do. I have AI analyzing your full account and transaction history to see if there's anything else I can offer you, and it looks like you qualify for a secure travel account that comes with a more secure card and won't cost you anything. Okay, sounds promising, but what about travel benefits? Well, this new account gives great travel rewards from transactions. I found that you  have a reservation at the MGM Grand later tonight. Yes, L'Atelier. I love that place. Have you been? Me? No, I don't go to restaurants. I can't pronounce the name, but it sounds nice. 


Okay, so let me get this straight. More security, more perks, and it doesn't cost me anything extra. Yep, that's right. Okay, that sounds great.  Let's do that. All right, well, your new card information is available in your app so you can configure it with Apple Pay. Enjoy your day and your lovely dinner, Colleen.

Okay, so I don't suppose anyone had joined a customer service call on your bingo card  today. That's okay. Being able to make a meaningful difference in customers' lives and build relationships—that makes human agent collaboration so powerful. As we work across multiple modalities with agents, our need for seamless escalations and human interaction still exists. It's exactly why we keep investing in capabilities that make people and AI agents true partners. In fact, earlier this  week, we launched eight new capabilities in Amazon Connect from Nova 2 Sonic integration that enables customers to problem solve through spoken conversations that sound natural, like the one you just heard,



to agents that make real time recommendations based on the customer conversation itself and automatically suggest next steps, then to AI  powered predictive insights that combine clickstream data and customer profiles to make highly personalized suggestions.  Over the next few years, human AI teams will fundamentally rewire how work gets done. They'll change how we build, how we ship, and how we serve customers. And here's what excites me the most: this isn't just about doing the same things faster. It's about unlocking capabilities we couldn't even imagine.


[![Thumbnail 5800](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/5800.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=5800)

Connect is a great example of how agents and humans can work together to solve problems efficiently. Everything we have shown today and everything we are building is all just the beginning of what's possible with agentic AI. When I think about the innovation that will happen between now and when we are back here next year, I can't help but be optimistic in every  step. We are making it easier for anyone to build and use these agents, but the technology we built is just one  part of the equation. The other, more critical part is you—the community of builders inventing and building these incredible things.


[![Thumbnail 5840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/38bb1d6543204168/5840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prVdCIHlipg&t=5840)

In October, AWS builders, partners, and schools in West Java, Indonesia, had a goal to create 2,000 GenAI apps. They far surpassed this, setting a Guinness World Record  for most apps made in an on-site event: over 15,000 GenAI apps. Almost all of these apps were dreamed up by high school students who were able to bring them to life with the help of their teachers and a few nonprofit staff. On  September 8th, we launched the AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon. The challenge was simple: build autonomous AI agents that solve real world problems.



This year, we saw 9,500 developers from across 127 countries participate in this global hackathon, and they were challenged to build, develop, and deploy working AI agents using Bedrock, SageMaker, Strands, AgentCore, Kiro, and many more. We received 625 agents covering use cases from fraud detection to infrastructure monitoring to agriculture health monitoring, showcasing how AI agents are being deployed across virtually  every industry out there. But the winning agent was built by Ajito Nelson. Ajito is from the country of Timor-Leste, where  waste management is an incredible challenge. The capital city of Dili produces over 300 tons of daily waste, yet more than 100 tons go uncollected each day, clogging the drainage systems, causing devastating floods, and creating serious health hazards.

Ajito built EcoLafaek, an autonomous AI agent that transforms every smartphone into an environmental monitoring tool, empowering citizens to become guardians of  their communities' cleanliness. He used Amazon Bedrock with Nova Pro for multimodal analysis, Titan for semantic  similarity search, AgentCore with Code Interpreter and web browser for automation, and AWS Lightsail with S3 storage. Citizens can now photograph waste issues and the AI instantly classifies waste types, assesses severity, and identifies hotspots, giving authorities the tailored guidance they need to prioritize cleanup efforts. This year we also had a fantastic initiative called  Road to re:Invent where teams got on buses with a challenge to build an agentic AI app en route to Vegas and compete for  the grand prize of $50,000.

I also want to congratulate the winners of this year's AI League and AWS Builders program. Builders compete by customizing and fine-tuning LLMs and agents for specific tasks. In 2026, we are going even bigger, increasing the grand prize to $50,000. You can check them out in the expo today. The energy and excitement we are seeing around agentic AI is truly incredible.  The winners from this year's championship and Road to re:Invent are here with us today. Please stand and take a bow.

Now I want you to think about that feeling again—that moment when you first made something work, when you first felt that rush of creation. That feeling is not just a memory anymore. With agentic AI, we are living in that moment every single day. We are at a point where anyone with an idea, whether you are cleaning our oceans, unlocking the mysteries of the human brain, or solving challenges that we haven't even  discovered yet, has the freedom to build it. The freedom to move from concept to impact at an unprecedented speed, to tackle problems that once seemed impossible, the freedom to create without limits.
