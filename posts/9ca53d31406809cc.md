### Understanding RAG and MCP: Definitions, AWS Tools, and Architecture Examples

 Hey, hello guys. Thank you so much for being here. It's really nice seeing everyone watching this important topic. We're going to talk a little bit about RAG and MCP and bring a vision a little bit more about business and architecture, what is the right choice, right? So before we start, who here has been using RAG nowadays?  Okay, and MCP? Yeah, fifty-fifty, I'd say. But nowadays MCP is more popular, right? But you need to address some situations and understand how you can make the best choice for your architecture or for a customer.  So we're going to talk a little bit about why it matters, right? The definition, really simple, about RAG and MCP. We're going to talk about your choices, the tools that you have on AWS to run MCP and RAG or how to design architecture, and we will do a comparison side by side. And the most important is the idea is to bring a decision framework that can help you in your company.

 So why does it matter? Nowadays, data is the base for all the AI stuff, all the generative AI, and it is accelerating and evolving rapidly. More and more people are using RAG, and nowadays MCP is so popular and people are using a lot of MCP, so we need to understand exactly what you need to use. That's a key choice when you design architecture for your customer or inside your company, and you need to know exactly what you're going to use. It involves a couple of risks like complexity, cost, and security, especially, okay? And again, the goal here is to bring a decision framework for you.

[![Thumbnail 120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=120)

[![Thumbnail 130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/130.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=130)

 So what choices do you have? RAG and MCP. RAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework.  It's mostly used to enhance your LLMs and work with your enterprise data. So you have a knowledge base, you have specific documents, you have your databases, and if you would like the LLM to work just with that data, you can use it. You can reduce hallucinations in this case, and you can keep answers aligned with your specific scenario in your company. Usually it's better for search, for Q&A, for knowledge base.

So MCP is the Model Context Protocol. It's basically to standardize all the communications between agents, right? It creates a pattern like HTTPS, like the old data, all the communication protocols. It's usually more used for the LLMs as tools. They need to take actions, they need to execute some actions. You can also read data, but it's usually for other use cases, okay? And usually it's better for automation, for system integrations, and tools that are to connect with your agents.

[![Thumbnail 200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/200.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=200)

[![Thumbnail 210](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/210.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=210)

 One option we have on AWS. So here is just a stack, it's just an example.  It's not an architecture. You have more tools than that that you can use. It really depends on the scenario that you'd like to design or the problem that you're trying to solve. But you have a couple of tools on AWS that you can use to design your RAG architecture, and you have a couple of tools that you can design your MCP or use your MCP server. Again, you can use one or another, you don't need to use all of this. We can go and see some examples here.

[![Thumbnail 250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=250)

 So here is a really basic example about RAG. All architectures that I'm showing here, they are available on AWS as a reference architecture or on the documentation. And here you have basically a user accessing a RAG application, talking to your LLM, and you have a vector database and all your documents, data, media, or whatever you need, okay? That's exactly what RAG does inside your knowledge base and your information here.

[![Thumbnail 280](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/280.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=280)

 Here is also RAG but with a little bit more complex architecture. Different scenarios here that you can use in your models or in your company. You can use OpenSearch, you can use LangChain, here you can use Bedrock. So it really depends on how you design your system or how you would like to solve your problem, okay?

[![Thumbnail 300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=300)

 Here's a reference architecture for MCP.

[![Thumbnail 330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=330)

So with MCP, you can use Fargate, Lambda, and all the authentication services on AWS that you use to support your MCPs. It's a basic architecture, a little bit more complex, but again, it takes action and does much more in this case. Here is a little bit more complex architecture, but in this case using  AgentCore, right? So here you have all the AgentCore runtime running your MCP services and connecting with other AWS services or external services here. You have memory and your other Bedrock services.

### Comparing RAG and MCP: Use Cases, Costs, and a Decision Framework for Implementation

 So we have a little understanding about architecture, and we understand how RAG works and MCP works, so the idea is doing a comparison  between them. Again, RAG is primarily for retrieval data. It's really only for retrieval. You're not taking actions, right? The content is relatively static, like the policies in your company, documents, or your risk tolerance. It's a little bit low, and it's a quick time to validate and implement. So the complexity is not so high, and you can implement it a little bit faster.

[![Thumbnail 420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=420)

MCP is usually used for your AI agents to interact with other tools. Maybe they need to connect with other services like Salesforce or any other services to take actions, and you can use MCPs usually for automations, workflows, and orchestration against these things. Here are some common use cases that you can use with RAG.  You can use it for document search, for example, or have a policy Q&A. Again, this is all documents that you have, and you would like to access your knowledge database chat. Each one of these use cases has a different architecture, and you can use different services, but basically RAG is recommended for this kind of services.

[![Thumbnail 450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/450.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=450)

[![Thumbnail 480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=480)

When you talk about MCP, again, you will see more automation, monitoring, integration  with other systems, API orchestration, workflow triggers, or even DevOps automation. So MCP will give you a lot of tools and more power to your application or your LLM to talk to other systems. One important thing about this comparison is exactly about cost. So I bring here just a comparison. Again, this can  be really different depending on your architecture. I give an example about 10,000 queries a day or 10,000 workflows a day using vector here, embedding, LLM inference, or MCP tools. You have more tools or functions and executions here, and you can see that the price really changes. So that's why you need to understand, especially about cost, what kind of architecture you should use or if you should even use a hybrid architecture, right?

[![Thumbnail 520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=520)

So here is a decision framework that you can  use when you think about what kind of architecture I would like to implement. Again, RAG alone is basically to provide information from your documents, from your knowledge base, your database that you like to retrieve all information based on that context, right? It's perfect for retrieval-only information. MCP is more for simple and isolated actions without a complex business context. So if you don't need a business context, you don't need your documents, you can use MCP. But now you can use the hybrid architecture. You can use both, right? Because you can have your business context in your RAG, and you can use MCP as a tool to access everything, so it's best for intelligent workloads or workloads that need to take some action or communicate with other systems.

There's a couple of strategies talking about costs that you can adopt. So first, use prompt caching because you don't need to send prompts every time or spend money with tokens. You need to reduce the count of tools that you use with MCP because if you have a lot of MCP servers working with a lot of tools inside, it will multiply your costs every time you execute an action, so that really needs to be well designed.

In this case, use batch operations. You can process a lot of things at the same time and reduce your cost, and it's really important to implement smart routing so that you can make a decision between using MCP or RAG without using LLM before using LLM. This will reduce the cost.

[![Thumbnail 660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/660.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=660)

So in a simple way, you can just ask: Do I need knowledge grounding? You can use RAG. Do I need tool orchestration or actions? Use MCP. Do I need both? Use a hybrid approach. And always consider cost, latency, and governance in this case. Talking about  the hybrid scenario, you can see again the comparison in costs between these three architectures. You can see that MCP alone, considering 10,000 workflows per day, is really more expensive. And here, if you implement all the cost strategies, you have a really good scenario for the same kind of architecture.

[![Thumbnail 700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=700)

Again, it really depends on your problem and how you design your system, but that's a fair comparison between these three architectures. All right, some key takeaways to wrap up  what we're talking about. Again, RAG is very good for your knowledge base. MCP is really popular right now because it is making all the LLMs or agents really powerful, accessing everything, but you have to care about costs and security. It's a little bit more complex, so you need to really think about it.

[![Thumbnail 750](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9ca53d31406809cc/750.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic3JunCBjf4&t=750)

But again, if you need a balance between power and complexity, you can use both. And AWS provides a lot of tools, as we've seen, like you can construct like building blocks and you can put both architectures together. So that's it. I would like you guys to connect with me. Here's all my social media, LinkedIn, YouTube. I'm always posting content about AI and LLMs, and  you can connect with me. Thank you so much.
