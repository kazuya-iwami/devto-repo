### Introduction: AWS Migration Pathways and Customer Panel Overview

 AWS for VMware migrations successes, roadmaps and strategies. I'm thrilled to be joined today by three of our customers. We have Tyler Barhydt, VP of Cloud and Infrastructure Delivery at Envision Healthcare, Angel Gonzalez, Deputy Director of Infrastructure for Aeroméxico, and Molly Greek, Chief Information Officer at the University of California. Thank you all for being here. I'm really looking forward to our discussion today.

[![Thumbnail 40](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d5f743dfa03bd699/40.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA7EkVJsxmE&t=40)

Now before we hear from these leaders, I'd like to point out that AWS is the longest standing  cloud provider helping customers migrate VMware workloads to the cloud. We understand that there's no one size fits all solution when it comes to cloud migration and modernization. Each organization has its own unique mix of applications, data, and infrastructure requirements, which is why we offer customers choice and flexibility.

Some customers may be running VMware workloads which have dependencies that they need to continue running in the cloud. Others are seeking to transform workloads through modernization, migration and modernization, leveraging cloud native technologies. Some customers have data residency requirements. Running AWS on premises can help meet that objective. And finally, some may be looking to expand how they virtualize their workloads, perhaps leveraging partner solutions.

[![Thumbnail 100](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d5f743dfa03bd699/100.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA7EkVJsxmE&t=100)

Diving a little bit deeper into this, AWS meets you where you are in your cloud  journey. We offer the most comprehensive migration and modernization pathways for your VMware workloads. Customers can relocate VMware workloads with Amazon EVS, our Elastic VMware Service, for a rapid lift and shift with minimal changes. You can re-host on Amazon EC2 leveraging AWS Transform for VMware to accelerate migrations.

You may have heard that we just launched enhanced agentic AI capabilities. This helps automate discovery, dependency mapping, and network translation. We have a couple of breakout sessions on AWS Transform for VMware later this week. I'll have information at the end of the presentation about those sessions, so be sure to check those out if you're interested.

Customers can also re-platform to containers with Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS to modernize application architecture. You could leverage managed services such as Amazon RDS, Amazon FSX, or Amazon Workspaces. This will help you reduce operational overhead. Or you could completely refactor and modernize applications with serverless and cloud native services for maximum agility and cost optimization.

These pathways are not mutually exclusive. Many customers pursue multiple approaches simultaneously and continue to iterate long after the first migration is complete. I'm curious to hear from the audience, how many of you are considering a migration of VMware workloads to the cloud through either EVS or EC2? Show of hands. It's a lot of you. What about how many are looking to modernize workloads through moving to containers or managed services and application refactoring? Great. So a lot of you should be very interested in the conversation today.

### Meet the Panelists: Envision Healthcare, Aeroméxico, and University of California

Now let's get to know our speakers a little bit better. Tyler, can you start us off and tell us a little bit about Envision Healthcare and your responsibilities there? Sure. Like you mentioned, I'm the VP of our Cloud and Infrastructure Delivery at Envision Healthcare. I have about 25 years of IT experience in various forms over the years. I've been there about 2.5 years and we focus on physicians, EMHM type work. We've got an interesting model where we actually staff physicians. We do our revenue cycle management work for them as well as scheduling and some other things on EMHM, anesthesiology, radiology, and so on.

Now Angel, could you tell us a little bit about Aeroméxico and your responsibilities? Sure. Well, my name is Angel Gonzalez, as you already mentioned. Aeroméxico is one of the largest airlines in Mexico. We fly to over 90 destinations in Mexico, Europe, United States, and Asia. I'm the Deputy Director of Infrastructure, so I'm in charge of several parts there like cloud, on-premises services, network, and several others. We've been on this journey to the cloud for about 4 years or so.

All right, thank you very much. And Molly, could you give us a brief introduction and overview of your responsibilities at the University of California? Sure. I've been at the University of California for about 15 years. I used to work at UC Davis Health and now I work at the system-wide office which is in Oakland. Many of you probably didn't know there was a system-wide office. But to just give you an idea about the scope and scale,

we provide shared services for the entire UC, which is 22 different organizations including a large healthcare presence. We do things like the undergraduate admission system for the entire UC, which receives 250,000 student applications every year worldwide. We also support all the hospitals and health systems—we have 6 major health systems. We manage the payroll and HR system for our current employees. UC is the second largest employer in California, and we also manage the HR, payroll, and benefit system for all of our retirees because we have a pension.

Thank you very much. I apologize I didn't have the slide up for University of California the whole time, so I'll leave that just for a second. Well, thank you all. I think everyone here is looking forward to hearing more from our panelists as they share their experiences. Tyler, why don't you start us off with Envision Healthcare? Tell us about your migration story.

### Envision Healthcare's Journey: From 11 Data Centers to Cloud-First Strategy



When I showed up about 2.5 years ago, we had on-premises infrastructure and a small cloud footprint. Radiology was there pretty heavily. We had a lot of acquisition work and M&A activity that created a lot of fragmentation. We had 11 or more data centers that were purpose-built, so not the traditional approach where we were running all workloads across all data centers. We really had to come up with an approach that would allow us to get into a cloud-first mindset and start to migrate.

Our end goal was to be flexible, so we didn't narrow down AWS as our only primary cloud provider. We have a few workloads that run in Azure as well, but we try to stay very open in our methodologies and where we could go. We really wanted to focus on consolidation of those data centers, how to get through that, how to start building some operational efficiencies, and how to gain cost savings and other benefits through the migration effort.

We leveraged different tools including AWS Transform for VMware, AWS Application Migration Service, Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and RDS Custom. In the early days, we focused on our SQL workloads, getting them into RDS and RDS Custom. With one of those data centers I mentioned, we were able to exit in 2025. Some of that was data center to data center migration, and some of it was being flexible, moving things directly into AWS through more of a lift-and-shift approach. We also went through an effort to migrate a bunch of workloads to Azure using Azure ABS.

We have plans now to get out of our last two primary data centers from that original 11. We look to get out of those by the end of this year, though we'll probably leak a little bit into 2027. The tools and methodologies were very useful in how we organized the environment. We really focused on taking the right workloads and getting them migrated. Initially, we started out thinking we had to modernize everything, which slowed us down. We got ahead of ourselves a little bit, moved things back and forth, and changed our policies, but we kept things moving.

We did leverage AWS workshops. We did a couple of Experience Based Acceleration sessions, which were very helpful. We did one earlier this year that was also very useful. We also brought in a partner—Presidio is our partner there with AWS—which really helped us put some structure around it. We brought in folks and dedicated them to this effort. We spent a lot of time up front. The tooling was very useful, but we did have to push folks to adopt it. We had two organizations, the on-premises folks and the cloud folks, and we brought them all together as one organization now.

We leveraged AWS SkillBuilder and a lot of that partnership with AWS on the efforts we did to really upscale folks as we went along the way. Deep down, I think it's been a very positive journey in partnership with how this works. Angel, why don't you take us through your journey at Aeroméxico?

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d5f743dfa03bd699/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA7EkVJsxmE&t=600)

### Aeroméxico's Amazon EVS Success: Moving 96 Servers in One Month



Sure, well, the journey started about 4 years ago.

One of the main strategies for Aeroméxico was not doing lift and shift per se. We needed to first create an architecture of the structure and document everything on paper. We also needed to start moving and really modernizing our applications, so we started dividing our applications. All of our applications were based on three main data centers. The idea was to lift all three data centers from on-premises and go fully cloud. A difference with what Tyler mentioned is that we are moving to only one cloud, only AWS, so that's one of our strategies. One of the goals was to move 346 to 350 locations out of those data centers, so we divided our strategies into mainly two: refactoring and re-platforming for our critical workloads. Then we started looking at different options. During this journey, we ended up having some obsolescence and a major tech refresh came up for us, so we decided to start looking into options with AWS with some assessment that you helped us with a service that you call Countdown, also with some specialists that you presented to us and start looking into Amazon EVS.

When we decided to go to Amazon EVS was because one of the main purposes was that our business partners who were focused on refactoring other applications needed to focus on that. So my team, as infrastructure, decided to do this application that was left on-premises that would take maybe 12 months to be moved from on-premises to cloud. One of the challenges that we had was that they wanted to keep our IP addressing in the cloud, so they didn't have to make any changes or major changes to the applications. Also, we needed to improve and start covering some vulnerabilities in cybersecurity that our cybersecurity team showed to us. We took Amazon EVS, we started analyzing, we started talking to our business partners to start knowing how they were handling their applications. One of our partners, DXC, which is managing all our on-premises applications, helped us really well because they were really knowledgeable about the infrastructure that we have there.

It was like a flip coin, to be honest, because we put all our efforts there in Amazon EVS and at the end, it came really well. We ended up moving 96 servers with more than 50 applications in only one month. So it was really successful for us. At the beginning, the goal was to move those loads really fast to the cloud, but at the end we ended up finding more capacity for our servers in operational applications that we have. Also, we found that some of our workloads and applications started running really fast, so the feedback that we received from our customers was really good. We enhanced performance, we enhanced cybersecurity, and we have a lot of things. Now we're running a lot of our workloads, and of course we will talk a little bit in the lessons learned, but we have a couple of robots.

It sounded like a key thing that you were able to do was to move the infrastructure without disruption to the application development, and you did that with Amazon EVS and the HCX technology to stretch the networks, correct? With HCX, we extended our on-premises network, and we ended up moving the workloads during the night. So there was no operational impact. We are of course an airline, so we have 24/7 support in our operations, so with no impact whatsoever for our clients and our customers. Great, I know you were an early adopter of Amazon EVS, and we thank you for that and your feedback through all that. I'm glad it's working out and helping with the rapid lift and shift there.

### University of California's Emergency-Driven Migration: Payroll, Admissions, and Mainframe Retirement

All right, I know you had some interesting application challenges to deal with at the University of California. Can you tell us a little bit more about that and your journey? Yeah, I wish my journey was so strategic. What we started with were emergencies that we had to deal with right away. So we had an HR payroll system that  serves about 280,000 employees, and we had a lot of performance issues. It was being managed by a vendor, and it was being managed on a different platform. We tried to get it to be fixed and get it better, but every single time we ran payroll, it took longer, and we were really looking at the point where at some point we wouldn't be able to run it on time.

That was the point where we said enough, we have to move to AWS. So we moved the system over. It took us about 6 months. We worked really closely with our AWS partners. You know, it's always nervous when you do those types of things, right? It's payroll. We have a lot of people that we pay, and if you don't get that right you're in the newspapers. But we moved it over and all of our performance problems were gone. It was absolutely amazing. I actually had the other vendor call me the day after and say how's it going, and I said, hey, all those problems we used to have, I guess it really was the infrastructure all the time.

So that was really a big success there. Then we had some other things that came up, like our undergraduate admission system. If you've ever dealt with someone applying for college, everybody likes to wait until the last 15 minutes to submit, so we have 250,000 applicants every year, and we close at midnight. In that last 15 minutes, about 15,000 people hit enter. Two years in a row our system crashed in that last 15 minutes, so we ended up in all the newspapers with parents and students panicking. We had to extend the deadline, and the president of the university said I don't care what you do, but it can't happen a third year in a row.

We tried a lot of things and a lot of performance management approaches, but this is a classic situation where demand spikes dramatically and then drops. You just can't put enough servers together for that. So we partnered with AWS, got it up there, and the really cool thing about that is they wanted it to succeed as much as we did. They were up with us at 11:59, adjusting dials and all that stuff. Actually, even now in our third year, they're still with us at midnight, making sure it goes well.

Following that success, we had to get off the mainframe. We knew we had a mainframe, so we moved off it. It was very expensive to operate a mainframe, and we had data that we had to keep. We have retention requirements where we need to keep data for either 50 or 99 years. But we moved it all to AWS and we turned off the mainframe and saved three million dollars. We worked with Deloitte to get that done. They're actually pretty good at turning off mainframes.

After we had all these different successes, we just said enough, we want to be on one platform. So we started a project to move everything else. We were really lucky because that was right about the time that the VMware situation was changing. We had a plan to get it all done in a certain period of time, but we had to accelerate that at the end to avoid the VMware costs, which we did. Now we're 100 percent in AWS. I think you really have to know what you're doing there. We'll talk more about lessons learned, but we worked with partners and at this point our team is so good because we've done it so many times that we're a lot more comfortable with it.

One thing I'll mention regarding security, and it's not something I'm super proud of, but I guess we're okay now. When we moved everything over, just by moving everything through, we resolved about 60,000 vulnerabilities. That's an important thing to think about. We're getting better performance, we were able to reduce cost, and we resolved a lot of our software vulnerabilities. Part of that is the fact that AWS is managing it for us so we don't have to constantly patch and patch and patch. The other piece is it forced us to look at everything on those servers. There was some old stuff on there that we didn't know what it was. We had things out there that had been there for 15 years that we didn't know about, but we had to go through and figure it all out.

[![Thumbnail 1130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d5f743dfa03bd699/1130.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA7EkVJsxmE&t=1130)

### Lessons Learned: Governance, FinOps, and Partnership Strategies

We had about 15 zombie servers running stuff we didn't even need. By going through that and getting rid of that stuff, we reduced our security vulnerability footprint and we reduced cost. Those are fantastic stories, and I think everyone's going to benefit from that. We'd like to transition now to our lessons learned section. I think the audience would love to hear from each of you a little bit about some of the challenges you had along the way and basically how you resolved those and things you'd like to share.  Tyler, do you want to start us off?

Sure, yeah. One of our big ones was really because of that fragmentation I mentioned. We had a lot of those lost toys. Fifteen is nothing. We had a ton of stuff in the environment that we just didn't know what it was or what was on it. It had been there for a long time with maybe one person using an application, et cetera. So really understanding that ecosystem, whether you have a good CMDB or not, or you just need something to come in and help with discovery, we were able to identify a ton of prior retains.

We ran into the same VMware cost situation, so we reduced from about 5,000 cores down to 22 in about 9 months just through those efforts of really pushing and driving from an IT perspective into the application owners in the business and calling out, okay, do you really need it? Because the first answer was always yes. We identified AS 400 stuff that had been out there for a while. We just kept pushing. So it was almost like don't take retain as the first answer or don't take the first answer as final.

You've got to push on it, which seems a little weird sometimes from IT where we're pushing the business on the need. Were you empowered to make those decisions? We partnered with them. Sometimes I'm looking for the illusion of choice in some of those conversations, but a little bit of that is leading them to say, "Here's where we're headed and here's what we're going to do." But a common vision is ultimately what we're after.

Angela, you want to share a few things? Yeah, I think the main challenge for us was at the beginning because we decided to use EBS. We came up with the idea of EBS this year, planted it this year, and executed it this year, so the time was really challenging. We needed to talk with cybersecurity teams and architecture teams to see how this would work, then contact our partner DXE and start looking into the solution, how we work, how we connect, and how we extend this connectivity to the EBS environment.

We started looking into all these pieces and then brought the teams together to see how their applications would run, if they would have concerns, and if they had time to test. They were focusing on other modernization efforts and other things, so those were some of the biggest challenges. You got their buy-in early to do testing so you didn't have to pull them off their development projects, but as you migrated infrastructure, they had buy-in to validate. They needed to validate, and also the users needed to validate. Then we had to go to the business and say, "We're moving these workloads that are really big and really important. The entire company knows our strategy for the main and critical applications we have, so taking this different approach was a bit difficult. We needed to show them that we would move these workloads in a different manner than they were used to, so they needed to test and help us, and now it's a shorter timeframe. That was a challenge as well.

But we also learned along the way. At the beginning, EBS was only a transition point. We were thinking of moving our workloads to EBS and then moving to another modernization plan that we would discuss later. But one of the things we found out is that all the benefits and agility that EBS gave us as a transition point made us think, "What happens if we keep some workloads here?" Not all of them, because we have other plans, but that's one of the things we started learning. At the end, we started reducing costs because we had already moved some of our workloads to the cloud, so we had on-premises services with bigger servers and a big environment that we didn't need anymore. So when we moved everything to EBS, we raised some costs initially.

What was the learning curve for the EBS move? You had VMware knowledgeable administrators and staff. I think the key point is that the knowledge our partner and my team had was kind of the same. Of course, we needed to learn a bit, but as I mentioned, the challenge was the time. They kept scaling up this service and were able to help us a lot because we had the main person to help us with this solution and these challenges. So the learning curve was really short.

Was there any resistance to the whole concept of moving to the cloud? A lot of people like to run their workloads in the place where they built them. Well, at the beginning, we had some barriers and some pushback, but at the end, we needed to move. You had some real deadlines. You had a bigger objective to close data centers and not do a tech refresh. The bigger objective was to close the data center. Got it. Thank you. That was really helpful.

Molly, for lessons learned for us, when we first started prior to me coming to the Office of the President, the Systemwide Office, they had given AWS to a lot of people in my group. They said, "Here's some training. Here's some access. Fly free. Just mess around." I would not suggest that as a strategy. When I came into the organization, people were really excited about AWS, which was really cool because people were really interested in the cloud. But what we had was people messing around, doing things that cost us a lot of money, doing things that weren't set up in a secure way, and doing things that weren't adding a lot of value. So I had to sort of claw it all back, which was not ideal. We did get interest, but you can't just have people throwing an app up into AWS while keeping the database in the data center. There were lots of things like that where people just didn't know because they were learning.

What we brought in was a cloud leader who had extensive experience doing cloud at two different organizations. This leader set standards, established governance, and put in the financial controls. We went from $50,000 a month to $10,000 a month in cost and massively increased security. However, I was very unpopular when I clawed it all back. That was one of my lessons learned: from the very beginning, you need to have governance, you need to have standards, and you need to have leadership—not just partners, but leadership in IT that knows what we're going to do and how we're going to do it.

Another big lesson learned for me came from our major project moving the HR payroll system, our very first project to AWS. We had it all planned with a budget, and then COVID hit and our budget got cut. It was really disappointing, but my team didn't want to tell the vendor anything. They thought vendors would just sell us stuff. However, treating the vendor like a business partner and saying, "This is what happened to us. We really want to do this, but our budget got cut and we don't see a way to do it," made all the difference. AWS was able to figure out some things with programs that we weren't even aware of, and that's what enabled us to move forward.

Whether it's AWS or any other vendor you're going to work with closely, treating them like a business partner and just telling them what's going on—this is our problem—maybe they can't help you, but at least you have trust. Or maybe they can help you in ways you may not have fathomed because they have access to different programs you might not know about. When there are problems, when you think you have to cancel, when there's problems with leadership, whatever it is, just be honest and be straightforward. They're already your business partners, so you may as well let them in on it to help solve the problem.

Something similar happened with us. When we started out, we had a couple of folks doing FinOps, and they were kind of isolated in their own little groups. They were pulled together recently, just ahead of when I actually got there, and we started that discipline within the organization. I wouldn't do this without it. If there's one thing you're going to set up first, it would be FinOps. Get an idea of what's going on in the environment and have the ability to find waste. We've identified a ton of wasted infrastructure on-premises and a ton in our cloud environments as well, but we stay on top of it.

We get the alert and they've got partnership out into the business, and it works really well when you show them the dollars. We go in and say, "Hey, what happened?" and it's not a month later, it's not two months later—it's within that first week typically that we identify that. Take advantage of the programs whether it be MAP or other migration assistance programs. Those things work with and partner with your partner and AWS to take advantage of those programs.

I totally agree. I take advantage of the MAP program as well. We use that and the FinOps approach. At the beginning, we had some questions on how this different approach with EBS would work. But having all these procedures, all the team, all the efforts, all the knowledge from AWS to control the budget and control this FinOps approach is really important for taking this kind of strategy. I think I heard a common thread across all three companies: getting that centralized buy-in and establishing a center of excellence is really important for setting a precedent for how this can be successful.

### Future Roadmaps: Modernization Plans, Team Development, and Automation

I remember you saying, Molly, that getting focused on a particular application—well, we had burning platform after burning platform, so it was easy. That makes it easy to pick. Very interesting. So let's transition now. Now that you were all running workloads in AWS, I'm curious about your thoughts on what the future holds, what's on your roadmap, modernization plans, or if you've already modernized, what's coming for you. Angel, why don't we start with you this time?

[![Thumbnail 1760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d5f743dfa03bd699/1760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA7EkVJsxmE&t=1760)

Sure. Right now we are around like we will end up 2025 around 25 to 90 percent of our applications on cloud with different strategies. Of course, we need to keep moving ahead and start maturing our applications, mainly our tier 2 and tier 1 applications. Talking about the applications that we have in EBS, we have a couple of options there. Our tier 1 and tier 2 applications will go through a refactoring process or a re-platform process for sure. But now we are starting to look into what tier 2 and tier 3 apps need to be modernized, which ones of them will be retired because maybe some of the features will go to another application that we already have and been modernized, or which ones of them will stay on-premises. 

For the applications we already have that have been modernized, or for those we need to decide which ones will stay on-premises, we need to think about how to improve reliability. We also need to start considering having another region from AWS for disaster recovery or backup plans for EBS. That is one of the things we are looking into, and our modernization efforts will continue to progress. We have other strategies that will leverage all the modernization we already have, so it is important to keep moving forward along the modernization path.

Teams are continuing to do modernization activities and will continue mainly for one of our towers that has some applications scheduled through 2026. Our plan is to end up with all our applications on cloud by 2026 and to decommission all three of our main data centers by 2026 as well. We had started this process years ago and recently finished it. We put everything we had into AWS and got done a little bit faster than we originally planned because of the VMware financial crisis that was coming our way.

There are things we can continue to do to modernize because we wanted to do things a certain way, but because of the VMware situation we had to move really fast. We are going back and doing some of the modernization efforts that some of those things moved over without. One piece that is not my usual strategy involves some of the partners we signed up with at the beginning. We had a partner take over our HR and payroll system because at the time we did not have a lot of cloud people and did not really know what we were doing. We thought they would be better at managing it than us.

Over time we have grown to be honestly better at doing it than they are. They make a lot of mistakes and charge us a lot of money. We recently put together a plan that says we are going to keep it on AWS but we are going to take it back. I do not normally want to do that. Usually you get people who are really good at this stuff, but our HR payroll system is a little customized. It is not cookie cutter. It is not easy. It is PeopleSoft, and it is very custom, so this vendor is not great at doing it, but we are because we live it.

We are going to pull that back in and hire ten people to do the care and feeding of it. I think our team is going to be better at it because over time we have been able to hire people that are all cloud people. We do not have to be in two worlds. We had a blend of things to do with those disparate data centers. We had some applications that we were able to modernize as we went. We had some that made sense based on data gravity that ended up in Azure, but we focused on that. We ended up doing ABS and that was just to get us out and shut down data centers.

We plan on being out of all data centers. There is one that really does not count that will be there for longer term, but somebody else manages it outside of the company. We plan on being out late 2026, maybe a little bit into 2027 where we will be full cloud in a hybrid configuration because we do have some other SaaS stuff that runs actually out in Oracle. From a modernization perspective, that is our goal now. As we move those things to ABS, we are going to modernize out of there and into AWS if there is some workload that makes sense. We can put it wherever we want, but the majority of that is going to go that way.

We plan on leveraging the AWS Modernization Lab. We are in talks with them right now on finding and identifying the right workload. We had some modernization lab discussions, yes, the AWS Modernization Lab. We are working with them to identify the right target for that to leverage some of those things that can use some of the new tooling to modernize and upgrade the code and document stuff. Some poor developer that came in and is long gone inherited that environment. What do you do to put some of that stuff in place?

We had issues with HA and DR capability, so that alone was enhanced as we migrated our workloads where it made sense. We still have some things that do not have as stringent of SLAs and things like that around it. We have tried to manage that. We also have a lot of applications that are moving to either an off-the-shelf or SaaS platform that we will just need to ride out. We have some to keep the lights on, so we may choose not to modernize those and just write them out and then make sure that we can decommission them in the end. We have got every flavor of thing going on in the environment that we have to manage.

As you have ongoing education for your teams with things like the AWS Well-Architected Framework, we leverage AWS Skill Builder. I actually referenced it during a cab ride over here—the driver mentioned he was learning AWS, so I pointed him toward Skill Builder as an example of where to find those types of classes and training. We've leveraged that heavily, and we've also blended the teams together. The folks who were in on-premises helped significantly with the migration into AWS, which would be similar with the EVS solution. We're partnering them up on the migrations and really trying to cross-train and get them together as a group rather than operating as two separate teams. Skill Builder has been huge in upskaling our staff.

Angel, is that something you make use of as well? Yes, and I also want to add that we're not only focusing on EVS, but on all other applications where we're doing modernizations. We're working today with our architecture team to create a framework for how we need to mature every application we have to really leverage and gain all the advantages that the refactoring of administrations can give us. This is a work in progress and part of the modernization plan we already have in place.

Molly, anything to add? Yes, I think because we've been doing this over a long period of time, as people leave, we've really been saying we're going toward cloud, so we're going to hire more cloud people. It's not like we started with a team of cloud experts. We had a couple, but over time, every time someone leaves, we bring in somebody who's really focused on that area. We also take advantage of the training that's offered because there are people interested in going that direction and can learn. However, I have a pretty aging organization. The average age of IT at my organization is 51, which might surprise you. Because a lot of people when they go to UC, they go there to retire and get a pension, right? So we have a lot of older folks who need to keep records for 9,999 years. Because of that, some of those folks are interested in learning, but some are like, "I'm only going to be here for three more years," so they kind of ride it out. We have different people there, but we've been largely successful at building that team out.

Any other modernization thoughts while we're on the topic? Anything you do to go with that automation-first mindset to get folks out of manual builds and into infrastructure as code with Terraform and those kinds of things? What we did to push that a little bit is that every week when we're on these get-togethers, I have an employee of mine who's constantly saying, "Give me more, give me more." So I fill his queue and keep him busy because there are so many things we can do from an automation perspective that we just weren't taking advantage of. I think we're getting into that and building it out as we go.

Did you leverage any of the Terraform? We're actually following strategies with Amazon Q, for example, for our developers. They're using it a bit more, and the idea here is for them to be more agile, to keep modernizing, and now new requests from the business will come out really fast with all this effort and modernization that we have. For EVS specifically, did you script the build of your environment? You stretched your networks and did migrations. How did you actually do the migrations? Did you do live migrations or did you do them at night? We did it at night actually. At the beginning, of course, there was a lot of planning before that, but yes, all of our migrations were at night. We needed really small time frames—one and a half hours—because of our operations, but yes, we did it at night.

Thinking ahead to maybe future modernization of those workloads, things like AWS Transfer for VMware could potentially play into discovery of that environment if you're interested. We're trying to look into AWS Transform actually to start moving those applications to the cloud, but they're fine where they are if you know. I'll just mention something because you said Amazon Q. We did find something that was helpful with that recently. Unfortunately, because we are an education organization, we have some custom stuff. I wish we had zero custom stuff, but we do. There's a tool in Q that allows you to go from Java 17 to 21 with help from their AI. We did utilize that for all of our 17 to move it to 21. It was actually really helpful. The team was skeptical of it at first. They said we'll try it with one and see, but they were pretty happy with it. I think with stuff like that as it matures and you can take advantage of it, we're even considering applications that we might write out as "keep the lights on" solutions.

It still may be of value if it's that one developer we don't know much about and we're afraid to touch or patch. We may still go ahead and throw it at these tools just to see what we get. It's about getting people to change that mindset a little bit—why not, right? Let's go ahead and throw this at it, see what it produces, and if it's easier to understand and maintain, even though we're just going to ride it out for the next year and a half or two, it still makes sense to run through those types of tools.

### Getting Started with AWS Migration: Resources and Next Steps

Any other thoughts on modernization?  Well, thank you very much. That was a great discussion. I think it was really beneficial for everybody. If you are interested in learning how you can get started, we recommend these basic steps. First, assess your VMware estate. We think the best way to do this is with an OLA, an optimization and licensing assessment. Customers tell us this is extremely valuable to them, even before they implement the recommendations of the assessment. A lot of the information provided is beneficial and can actually save you money.

Second, leverage the AWS partner network. We have over 460 migration competency partners who can help you with your migration. Don't hesitate to work with them as you've seen several of our customers here have done that with various partners. Next, decide on your approach and strategy. Do you want to start with a single application, maybe help improve performance or increase resiliency, or perhaps you're facing a hardware refresh or a data center lease expiration and you've got a compelling event where you've got to make a decision and move the whole thing and plan a full data center migration.

Once you've decided on your approach, we can help you with training, support services, and purpose-built technologies. We've got ISV tools that can help with migration services, and also incentive programs like MAP, as was mentioned several times. We really want to help you. Please partner with your AWS account team. If you have a technical account manager or an account essay, don't hesitate to ask them what they can bring to the table for you in terms of funding or third-party tools.

I also want to leave you with these QR codes for a few resources that you can leverage this week, including the AWS for VMware re:Invent guide. This will help you quickly locate interesting VMware sessions at the conference this week. We've got a nice blog post together with all of those.  Next, there's a link on getting started with the migration assessment. This will help you reduce costs and build your business case. And then finally, a link to the AWS for VMware website where you can keep up with our latest offerings and announcements.

This slide here showcases all the additional AWS for VMware sessions happening this week at re:Invent. A couple to call out: there's an AWS Transform workshop Tuesday at 12:30 p.m., as well as two AWS Transform breakout sessions on Wednesday morning. There's a number of chalk talks, including an Amazon EVS deep dive Wednesday afternoon, as well as an EVS deep dive into networking and storage architecture on Thursday.  Please stop by our migration and modernization neighborhood in the AWS Village for demonstrations and Q&A with our experts.
