### Oracle Multicloud: Bringing Native Exadata Database Services to AWS

 Can you hear me okay? Perfect. All right, wonderful. So the agenda for this, I'm so privileged to have one of our valuable customers, Equifax, with me today to share their experiences as well on the multicloud. But I'm going to spend like seven to eight minutes talking through some general overview topics and then hand it over to Avinash, and then we'll try to leave four or five minutes if you have any questions to go through that. All right, my name is Kambiz Aghili. I'm Vice President of Product for OCI in charge of Multicloud, so thrilled to be here with you.

[![Thumbnail 50](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/c393190d178e6ba8/50.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQBSqKYHr5A&t=50)

A couple of things I wanted to talk about to establish what multicloud is. Oracle  has been a best-in-class database, reliable database technology for the past 40 years. Any of the eight or nine out of ten verticals, customers within each vertical you look at, they're utilizing Oracle one way or another. And Oracle has always been available on premises across different deployment models, and this is the first time that we're bringing the Oracle end-to-end Exadata technology and entire database services and all the surrounding elements of the Oracle technology natively available through AWS. So Oracle is in all clouds, including now AWS and Azure and natively operating from data centers, operating from the Exadata hardware, and we'll talk about some of the things that are so unique about it as opposed to operating just on commodity hardware.

[![Thumbnail 110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/c393190d178e6ba8/110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQBSqKYHr5A&t=110)

So we've been working really hard since last year to continue to innovate on behalf of the customers.  If I were to classify three categories of innovations that we work really hard on based on customer requirements to deliver, there are threefold. One is on simplifying the management and operations of the database. So customers now have access to tools to automate. The database infrastructure is code. They can utilize APIs, CloudFormation, as well as Terraform, so it simplifies the end-to-end of their journey.

Two, now we do offer customers the full automated data protection in near real time, whereas they can utilize an Autonomous Recovery Service that was never available through a third-party cloud natively operating on our hardware before. Third is security. We understood that it's really critical for customers to be able to not only use our Oracle technology in terms of a database and all the underlying services we offer, but also to be able to integrate very well with AWS's best-in-class cloud and AI, as well as the operational services around us.

So for instance, from a security perspective, now we offer as of last week integration with the AWS Key Management Service, and this is really fantastic because customers who love to use KMS are able to utilize that on Oracle operating natively from the AWS data center like never before. And on that angle, they are also able to continue to use other services around security, including Vault and Oracle Key Vault. So when you look at the multicloud, it's basically operating all the Oracle database services and services around it, operating on native Oracle hardware infrastructure from the AWS data center with the native interoperability of the Oracle technology alongside all the AWS services that customers would love to use.

So there's a ton of integration that we have put in place. You saw the prior presentation as well that you want to use AWS Bedrock, you want to use GenAI applications. So this gives you the ability to combine the data from the Oracle workloads and Oracle Exadata and Autonomous AI database with the AWS services and AI capabilities natively integrated with one another. So when you're building or modernizing new applications that need to utilize AI or need to utilize the best breed of both technologies, this is for the first time it's available.

[![Thumbnail 300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/c393190d178e6ba8/300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQBSqKYHr5A&t=300)

And the third piece, in addition to integration, is just making sure that we have federated or otherwise having all these surrounding services around our operational governance and security and data protection to be also available natively and integrated with AWS. As the two key players there, this has never been done before. Exadata has been the best-in-class hardware  technology for running database services.

[![Thumbnail 340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/c393190d178e6ba8/340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQBSqKYHr5A&t=340)

It's the unique technology that allows you, from an enterprise-class set of workloads, to have zero RTO and RPO within a region across multiple Availability Zones, as well as getting to near-zero synchronous Data Guard and building active-active configurations across the regions. So all of these are now available natively to AWS customers that would love to utilize both services across AWS regions that are operating Oracle workloads. Again, it's a full end-to-end feature parity, performance parity, MAA architecture of the Oracle  technology that customers have used for 30, 40 years, available natively to them from AWS on their Oracle Database at AWS. Specifically, not to confuse with the other services that are operating on the commodity hardware in AWS, but it complements them for the most part.

We have low-latency networks built out into the configuration, whereas customers who were running applications and the database tiers independently of one another, separately from one another, these are now operating from the same data center with microsecond latency in between. So as you're thinking about agentic AI applications, modernizing your applications, or building new configurations over time, that latency plays a very unique role into the horizon going forward. Seamless experience. Customers will have the same experience going to the AWS Marketplace as they do with any of the other first-class AWS services. They can utilize the AWS Partner Advantage and all the other capabilities and financial means available to them to procure and pay for Oracle services operating natively from AWS.

And then, as I indicated, connecting these services to one another is built in natively into what we have offered. So I'm going to stop there for a second and hand over to Avinash from Equifax to share their experience. One thing I wanted to share is that we launched last year at GA, so this is an enterprise-class service with hundreds and hundreds of customers already on it. We are available in US East, US West 2 Availability Zones, multiple Availability Zones each. We are launching three more regions with multiple Availability Zones at the end of this month, where 20 more regions are aligned in the next nine to ten months to go live and GA accordingly. So this is a service going to be available in and around the world, everywhere customers need it. Avinash, take it over.

### Equifax's Journey: Leveraging Autonomous Database at AWS for Enterprise-Scale Billing Systems

Thank you. Hello everybody, are you able to hear me? Cool. So I will talk a little bit about Equifax. I think most of the people in the US at  least are using Equifax as one of the major credit bureaus. We are not just a credit bureau company, we are a data company. We have all the consumer data and all.  So why Equifax, basically? So I mean, it's a very loaded slide. I cannot go through everything based on the given time I have. So I will just talk a little bit about how Equifax is using AI and then AWS and all other cloud-provided services.

So Equifax built its own cloud internally. We call it the Data Fabric Layer, and we harness all the data of the consumer and provide the insights of the data to the consumer for their benefits. So we are mainly providing three major services: Employer Workforce Solutions, US Information Systems Solutions, which is mortgage services and all. If you go for any mortgage, any bank or any lenders, they use our Equifax services for all the verifications. Employment verification. If you join any company and a company needs to do the verification, they use our services. So Equifax has a lot of services. These are the major services which most of the people are aware of.

So I was just talking about how all the data that Equifax uses and provides by maintaining that Equifax Cloud. So we have that internal Equifax-owned design for our cloud infrastructure to provide the real-time insight, multi-data asset at scale, and improve the speed and performance, because when you need or any B2B, our customer needs any data, their performance and speed is very important, right? So there are a lot of topics. I mean, you guys can have that access through the slide. You can read through that. Any question, always ready to answer further.

[![Thumbnail 580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/c393190d178e6ba8/580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQBSqKYHr5A&t=580)

So we are using Autonomous Database  at AWS because we have that. So I support basically all the enterprise data and financial systems. So financial systems consist of the billing system, which is a very highly OLTP database we need. So currently we are having billions of users' records come to our system, and then we have to process. We have three major billing cycles.

Before the billing cycle, we have to rate all the data, build the data, create the billing data, create the invoice, and ship the invoice. So it's always very time-constraint related. We need a very high-performance system to perform that, otherwise we have a revenue loss. If we don't ship the invoices on time, then we will have a revenue loss. Also, we cannot immediately remove the data from the system, so we need high storage capacity for the data.

[![Thumbnail 650](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/c393190d178e6ba8/650.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQBSqKYHr5A&t=650)

This is a high-level architecture of how the data comes to the system and how we process it. Certain points are there, such as high-volume usage processing, dynamic order management, and all that. So what are the major key benefits that we are getting using Autonomous Database?  Currently we are using Amazon RDS Oracle, which is definitely a very good service. We have been using RDS for our BRM system for seven years. Over that seven-year period of time, our database has grown tremendously, so we are at the verge of around 64 terabytes.

The good news is that yesterday it was announced that we now have the 256-terabyte version of RDS. But the reason for moving to Autonomous Database is basically that it is sitting in AWS using all the infrastructure of Exadata Database Service, which is sitting in AWS. As Kambiz mentioned, the data is sitting in the AWS data center, so all of our applications are sitting in AWS. So it's seamless, with no latency and no issues. Even if we want to use that Exadata service in OCI, we will have to deal with the latency between AWS and OCI. So this is the best of both worlds.

The major benefit is optimized performance and throughput. We are a very highly OLTP system. As I mentioned, we have to do the usage on time, create the billing and invoices, and ship the invoices. So we need a very high-performance system, which the underlying Exadata is definitely going to help us with. Scalable storage and data visibility is another key benefit. Exadata provides petabytes of storage, so we don't have to worry about storage constraints, which other database services have.

For example, currently to manage RDS, we have a 64-terabyte limitation. So we have to, every quarter, purge the data and then archive the data or whatever we are purging, because it's billing data. We cannot just purge it. So we have to maintain a lot of archives because of that process and limitation. With Exadata and the petabytes of storage capacity, we don't need to worry about that. And also, when our data grows in size, Exadata performance will help to navigate that data.

If we use any other service for Oracle databases to run, like on-premises or whatever, we have to do a lot of maintenance activities for that. So that is one of the best benefits we are getting using this service. As I mentioned, it's a unified cloud workload because it is sitting within AWS. We have a lot of AWS services we are using, so seamless integration is another key benefit we are getting through Autonomous Database.

We also have one important part, which is Oracle 23ai and Oracle 26ai. Oracle 26ai was announced recently. So by moving to this, we are making our data AI-ready. The application has been constrained because we are using Oracle Billing and Revenue Management system, which is Oracle's product. It may lag on their roadmap for AI enablement, but what we could do by moving to Autonomous Database is make our data AI-ready. So we can have our own AI solution sitting on Autonomous Database using Exadata and all that, which is available as part of Autonomous Database. So these are the major benefits. Due to time constraints, I will just pass it to Kambiz.

Yeah, sure. Thank you, I really appreciate it. All right, so there are a bunch of places you can go to learn more.  Just simply search for Oracle Multi-Cloud, search for MultiCloud on Google. Some of the links here I'm sure you can't remember, but the video recording will be available on the AWS website in a couple of weeks. And I wanted to dedicate between Avinash and I four to five, six minutes for any questions you might have. So there's a microphone out there if you have questions. We are here at your disposal. 

I should have taken more time. All right, I'll give you back the two minutes. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thanks for being here. Bye. Thank you, Kambiz. Thank you.
