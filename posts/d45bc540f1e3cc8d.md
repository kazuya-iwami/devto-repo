### Introduction to NET337: Simplifying Remote Site Connectivity with AWS

 Hello, everyone, and welcome to the NET337 session, Simplify Connectivity from Remote Sites. I'm Nishant Kumar, and I'm a Senior Product Manager in the AWS Networking team. I focus on network remote site connectivity and network monitoring products. I also have Mark with me, who will be speaking later in the session today.

[![Thumbnail 30](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/30.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=30)

 Before we get started, let me cover some housekeeping items. This is an advanced-level session, so we expect that people here are familiar with networking concepts and networking services such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC, AWS Site-to-Site VPN, Transit Gateway, Cloud WAN, and other related services. We will be covering a bunch of topics in the session today, so we won't be doing an end-to-end deep dive on one topic. Please watch out for QR codes throughout the session, which you can refer to later if you want to get more details. Finally, we will be walking you through multiple tables, charts, and sample architectures, and whenever the buildout is ready, you can take a screenshot.

 So, the agenda for today focuses mainly on all the cool capabilities that we launched this year for Site-to-Site VPN and how it is helping customers simplify the connectivity from their remote sites to workloads or applications in AWS. We'll start with a quick overview of the Site-to-Site VPN service, and then we'll get right into all the major capabilities that we are going to discuss today.

[![Thumbnail 100](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/100.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=100)

 We'll start with Secrets Manager integration and how this feature provides enhanced security for your pre-shared keys, or PSKs. Second, we'll be talking about IPv6 support and how you can now build end-to-end IPv6 VPN connections. We'll be talking about VPN Concentrator, a cool new feature for Site-to-Site VPN which will help you connect a large number of remote sites to AWS directly, especially when the sites have low bandwidth requirements. Then we'll be talking about the 5 Gbps VPN tunnel. Today, as many of you might know, Site-to-Site VPN tunnels support up to 1.25 gigabit bandwidth, but with this enhancement, now you can achieve up to 5 gigabits of throughput per VPN tunnel. Finally, we'll be talking about BGP logs and how it will further help simplify troubleshooting VPN connectivity issues. And finally, Mark here will be talking about how AWS and eero are working together to further simplify remote site connectivity.

 As we start the session, here's a quick trivia question for everyone. When did we launch Site-to-Site VPN? Show of hands, who thinks it's 2007? I see a few hands here. What about 2009? I see a lot more hands here. The right answer is 2009. We launched Site-to-Site VPN alongside the launch of Virtual Private Cloud back in 2009.

[![Thumbnail 190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=190)

 Over the past 16 years, we have launched 30 or more new features on Site-to-Site VPN thanks to all the feedback from all of you.

[![Thumbnail 200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/200.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=200)

### AWS Site-to-Site VPN Fundamentals and Common Connectivity Patterns

 Coming to the basics of Site-to-Site VPN, AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a fully managed service which allows you to connect your remote sites to the workloads in AWS. The way it works is that on your on-premises site, you have your gateway devices which connect to one of the gateways on the AWS side. That gateway could be a Virtual Private Gateway, Transit Gateway, or a Cloud WAN core network. Whenever you establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection, we provision two tunnels, and both these tunnel endpoints live in different availability zones for high availability reasons.

Since this is a managed service, you don't need to worry about any patching and tunnel maintenance work, and the service takes care of it. Due to this reason, we highly recommend that whenever customers are using Site-to-Site VPN connections, they use both tunnels so that in case of any traffic interruption on one tunnel, you can still use the other tunnel as a backup.

Now, let's look at some of the common connectivity patterns in terms of how customers connect their sites using Site-to-Site VPN. The most simple and straightforward is using Virtual Private Gateway, or VGW, to connect your remote sites to AWS, and this is specifically helpful if your deployment pattern is pretty simple. What I mean by that is if you need to connect your sites only to a single VPC in AWS, Virtual Private Gateway is very simple and handy, especially because your routing needs are going to be simple. But when it comes to complex routing needs and you need to connect multiple VPCs to your remote sites, that is when Transit Gateway and Cloud WAN come in handy.

[![Thumbnail 310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=310)

[![Thumbnail 330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=330)

So besides  being able to connect to multiple VPCs, the other advantage that you have when you are using Transit Gateway or Cloud WAN is that you can use complex protocols such as ECMP, equal cost multipath, to get around the limitation of 1.25 Gbps, and you can even do higher throughput. We'll talk about this more when we cover the 5 Gbps  tunnel. And finally, the third and most common pattern is using site to site VPN over AWS Direct Connect service. So a lot of customers use AWS Direct Connect for private connectivity, but then they use site to site VPN over that to ensure end to end traffic encryption. And while this is not mentioned here, the other common pattern that we see with Direct Connect is customers using Direct Connect as their primary connectivity source and using site to site VPN as a backup for that connection.

[![Thumbnail 370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=370)

So I know this was a 10,000 foot view. Here are some additional links which provide more details around  what are some of the considerations that you should keep in mind when configuring site to site VPN with any of these gateway devices. And then we also have a link for the blogs, which provides a complete end to end walkthrough of how you can do all of this configuration.

[![Thumbnail 390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=390)

[![Thumbnail 400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=400)

[![Thumbnail 420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=420)

### Enhanced Security with AWS Secrets Manager Integration for Pre-Shared Keys

So let's start with the first topic of the day, which is  AWS Secrets Manager integration with site to site VPN. Now, PSK or pre-shared  key is one of the most common and default methods of how customers do the authentication when they are establishing IPsec tunnels between the AWS VPC and their customer gateway device on the remote on-premises or remote site. And this usual standard and default  method to store your PSK credentials is using the site to site VPN service itself. So it's pretty basic. When you are creating a VPN connection, either you can specify your own PSK or the service itself can assign one for you. And then site to site VPN service stores these credentials, and when you run a get API call, you can access your PSKs.

[![Thumbnail 450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/450.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=450)

Now, with Secrets Manager integration, Secrets Manager is another AWS  managed service, which allows customers to store and manage their secrets such as database credentials, API keys, and everything. And with Secrets Manager integration now, when you use this method for storing your PSKs, when you run your get API calls, you do not directly get the PSK credentials, but you are pointed towards a Secrets Manager resource name or ARN as we like to call it in AWS. And then this helps you basically centralize all your secret management for your PSKs for all your VPNs in your network through Secrets Manager.

And one of the added advantages of using Secrets Manager here is that it also integrates with AWS CloudTrail logs, so you can actually have a trail and audit of who and when they have accessed your PSKs. And the best part is that there is no additional cost for using this capability. So next time when you are creating a VPN connection and planning to use pre-shared key as your authentication method, I highly recommend trying out the Secrets Manager integration.

[![Thumbnail 530](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/530.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=530)

### End-to-End IPv6 Support: Outer and Inner Tunnel IP Addresses

Moving to the next topic then, IPv6 support on outer tunnel  IPs. So as many of you may be familiar, whenever you create a site to site VPN connection, for each tunnel, you get two types of IP addresses. One is the outside IP address and one is the inside IP address. Now, outside IP address is used to establish the connection, but it is the inside IP which you essentially use in your routing tables to send traffic to and from AWS to on-site or vice versa.

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=600)

So when we launched the service, both the inside and outside tunnel could support only IPv4 addresses. And back in 2018, we launched the capability where the inner tunnel IP address can either be an IPv4 or IPv6, but the outside tunnel still needed to have an IPv4 address scheme. So this kind of helped bridge the gap where customers who wanted to deploy IPv6 connections, but one of the challenges that customers were running into is that they still needed to do IPv4 to IPv6 and then back to IPv4 translation. So earlier this year, we added the support where you can now have both  IPv6 on your inner tunnel as well as your outer tunnel IP address.

IPv6 support on outer tunnel IPs helps customers in regulated industries where they have mandates to move to IPv6-only networks. If you are migrating or connecting to other sites that are a mix of both IPv4 and IPv6, this capability can still help you. Another advantage is lower cost. If you use public IPv4 for your outer tunnel IP addresses, there is a cost associated with it. However, if you are using IPv6, there is no additional cost for using this service.

One of the most common questions I receive is whether there is a difference in terms of functionality of the site-to-site VPN service when using IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. The answer is no. The service in terms of feature parity is exactly the same. The blog post provides an end-to-end walkthrough of how you can use an IPv6 address on your outer tunnel IP and includes a CloudFormation template that makes deployment easier.

[![Thumbnail 610](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/610.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=610)

### VPN Concentrator: Connecting Large Numbers of Low-Bandwidth Remote Sites

 VPN Concentrator is a feature specifically geared towards use cases that require customers to connect a large number of remote sites to access their applications or workloads in AWS. The key trend is that all of these sites have pretty low bandwidth requirements, meaning 100 Mbps or under. When we launched the regular site-to-site VPN service, many customers who needed to connect remote sites preferred the model of connecting these remote sites to their on-premises data center, and then from their on-premises data center to AWS using the site-to-site VPN service. In those cases, the 1.25 Gbps VPN made a lot of sense.

[![Thumbnail 690](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/690.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=690)

 Over the years, we realized that customers wanted these sites to be connected directly to AWS, and our existing 1.25 Gbps VPN was not optimized for this use case. With VPN Concentrator, we are solving this problem. When you want to connect a large number of sites to your transit gateway to access the workload behind it, the first step is to create a VPN Concentrator. This creates an attachment between your transit gateway and the concentrator, and this attachment is what all your sites will use to communicate with all the workloads behind the transit gateway.

[![Thumbnail 760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=760)

[![Thumbnail 810](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/810.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=810)

[![Thumbnail 820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=820)

 The second step after you create your VPN Concentrator is to provision your VPN connections that connect to this VPN Concentrator. One of the most obvious advantages is that previously, if you had four sites that needed to connect to the transit gateway, you needed to create another transit gateway attachment for each site.  With VPN Concentrator, you do not need to create an attachment per site.  You can connect up to 100 remote sites using the same single VPN Concentrator.

[![Thumbnail 860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=860)

The key thing to keep in mind is that the individual bandwidth per site is capped around 100 Mbps, and the total bandwidth supported at the VPN Concentrator is 5 Gbps. You must ensure that as you connect more and more sites, you do not exceed the aggregate bandwidth limit. For example, if you have a 50 Mbps requirement per site, you can easily connect 100 sites to the same concentrator.  This is a more cost-efficient solution geared towards simplifying how you can connect a large number of sites to AWS.

[![Thumbnail 890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=890)

We have seen many requests coming in from customers with distributed enterprise setups, such as restaurant chains with many franchisees, and healthcare customers who work with small clinics and hospitals that need to access their workloads directly in AWS.  Let's compare the VPN connections that you provision through your VPN Concentrator with regular VPNs. In terms of availability,

whenever you create a new site-to-site VPN connection, we provision two tunnels, and both tunnels are in separate availability zones to ensure high availability. This remains true even with your VPN connections connected through the VPN concentrator. In terms of bandwidth with the concentrator, each site can do up to 100 Mbps bandwidth, but the total bandwidth is capped at 5 Gbps. You need to make sure that you don't exceed the overall bandwidth as you keep adding more sites. With your regular VPNs, you have the 1.25 Gbps tunnel and the 5 Gbps tunnel, and we will be shortly talking about the 5 Gbps tunnel after this.

[![Thumbnail 980](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/980.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=980)

In terms of the gateway supported, right now VPN concentrator only works with your Transit Gateway. Remaining features like IPv6, tunnel maintenance, accelerated VPN, and VPN logs all of these features work both for your VPN connections through a concentrator or your regular existing VPNs. Finally, the ECMP protocol, or equal cost multipath support, which allows you to bundle multiple VPN connections to get a higher throughput, is not supported on concentrator today. Over the next few slides  I will essentially talk to you about some of the main configuration steps that are involved with a VPN concentrator.

Obviously, I will not be covering all the configuration steps here, and the blog link provides a good job of how you can do this setup. Before I start that, I wanted to share something which is a common question I get around VPN concentrator: if I have multiple sites connecting through VPN concentrator, can the two sites talk to each other? The answer is yes, they can talk to each other and you can use both IPv6 and IPv4 there.

[![Thumbnail 1050](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1050.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1050)

There are two key main steps required when you are creating a VPN connection through a VPN concentrator. The first step is creating the VPN concentrator itself, and the second step is creating your VPN connections through this VPN concentrator. When you log into your Amazon VPC console, under VPN, you will see a new option called site-to-site VPN concentrator. As you can see, I already have two concentrators here, and I select the create new concentrator option. 

[![Thumbnail 1080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1080)

The key thing here to specify is the transit gateway that your concentrator will connect to. What essentially ends up happening after this step when I click on create VPN concentrator is that it creates a transit gateway concentrator attachment between your transit gateway and VPN concentrator. As a reminder, this is the same attachment that will be used to communicate across all the sites that will be connecting to your concentrator. 

[![Thumbnail 1090](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1090.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1090)

[![Thumbnail 1100](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1100.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1100)

It takes a few minutes when you configure this. I think it can take anywhere around five to ten minutes, usually for the concentrator to be in available state.  Once your concentrator is in available state, as you can see here right now, there are no VPN connections here. I'll go ahead and click on create VPN connection. 

If you have configured VPN connections today, this page will look very familiar to you. The reason is because there are only a couple of parameters that have changed. One is under target gateway type, now you will see the option of selecting VPN concentrator. When you're connecting your VPN connections through the concentrator, go ahead and select the VPN concentrator, and then you specify the current VPN concentrator that we created. Next step is to specify your customer gateway devices. This is the same method as we do today, and customer gateway essentially represents your gateway device at the on-site. In this example, I have selected one of my existing customer gateway devices.

There is one important thing I forgot mentioning earlier: with VPN concentrator, only BGP is supported for routing. Static routing is not supported. This is the reason why when you look at the screen, you see static as grayed out and you will have to use BGP here. I haven't shown the other parameters that you need to configure for this connection, and the main reason is because they remain exactly the same as what you do today with your regular VPN connections. This blog here again provides additional details on how to do the end-to-end configuration.

Next time if you have requirements where you need to connect a lot of sites, I would say usually 25 plus sites is the good middle ground where you need to connect these sites and have a low bandwidth requirement. That is really where the benefit of concentrator kicks in, not only in terms of operational overhead, but also in terms of cost efficiency.

[![Thumbnail 1240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1240.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1240)

### 5 Gbps VPN Tunnel: Meeting High-Throughput Requirements

Moving to the next topic, the 5 Gbps tunnel. This is interesting. So far, we were talking about VPN concentrators for connecting remote sites that have low bandwidth requirements. The 5 Gbps tunnel is actually the opposite end of the spectrum, where we have customers who found the 1.25 Gbps VPN connection insufficient given the nature of their workload. What ends up happening today is that many of our customers use site-to-site VPN in conjunction with Direct Connect.  Either as a backup or running site-to-site VPN connections over your Direct Connect. Some of you might be familiar that Direct Connect provides higher throughput, such as 5 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or even 10+ Gbps throughput.

What ended up happening was that because site-to-site VPN tunnels could only do 1.25 Gbps, customers had to rely on using the ECMP protocol. The ECMP protocol helped you by enabling it on your transit gateway so that all the VPN connections attached to your transit gateway were logically bound together, allowing you to get higher throughput and exceed your 1.25 Gbps per tunnel limit. This works when you have fewer VPN connections or fewer Direct Connects, but eventually it started adding significant operational overhead and complexity for customers to maintain. One other observation we had was that ECMP, while it works well in most cases, may not always deliver consistent bandwidth performance depending on highly latency-sensitive workloads or highly data-intensive workloads.

[![Thumbnail 1340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1340)

The 5 Gbps tunnel support is aimed at solving this problem so that ideally you don't have to use, or at least reduces the need to use, protocols like ECMP to get higher bandwidth. One thing to be mindful about the 5 Gbps tunnel is that when you create a VPN connection, you have two options to select your bandwidth.  The default or standard option is still your regular 1.25 Gbps VPN connection. If you are interested in using the 5 Gbps VPN connection or 5 Gbps tunnel, you select the large option. From a configuration perspective, everything remains the same. The only thing that has changed is the new addition of the tunnel bandwidth parameter.

[![Thumbnail 1400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1400)

One thing to keep in mind is that you cannot change the tunnel bandwidth for your existing connection. What I mean by that is if you have provisioned a 1.25 Gbps VPN today and want to move to a 5 Gbps VPN, you need to first create a 5 Gbps VPN connection, migrate your existing connection to that, and then finally delete your old 1.25 Gbps VPN connection. This is applicable both ways, so you cannot move from 5 Gbps to 1.25 Gbps VPN either.  In terms of feature parity between your 1.25 Gbps VPN connections and 5 Gbps VPN connections, it is pretty much the same. There are just two main differences. One is that accelerated VPN is not supported with your 5 Gbps tunnel, but it is supported with your 1.25 Gbps tunnel. The other thing is in terms of the gateways supported, it is only supported on Transit Gateway and Cloud WAN. It is not supported on Virtual Gateway. Other than that, all the features are supported for both tunnels, including ECMP.

[![Thumbnail 1500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1500.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1500)

I know we talked about the ECMP protocol and the inability to move between 1.25 and 5 Gbps VPN connections. But what you can do if needed is use ECMP between your 1.25 Gbps VPNs and 5 Gbps VPNs. The way it would work is that imagine you have a transit gateway with ECMP enabled, and you have one VPN which is 1.25 Gbps and another VPN which is 5 Gbps. In that case, you can logically bind them together to get higher throughput. For any additional considerations, you can refer to the blog post, which talks about how you can deploy the 5 Gbps VPN connections. So next time when you have higher throughput requirements, I hope you no longer have to rely on ECMP to get that and can directly use the 5 Gbps tunnel. 

### BGP Logs for Enhanced Troubleshooting and Key Themes Recap

Moving on to the next topic, which is support for BGP logs. BGP Logs

Two weeks ago, we added the capability to publish  your BGP logs for your VPN tunnels to AWS CloudWatch. This is aimed at providing you better and greater visibility into your VPN connections to help you troubleshoot VPN connectivity issues. Before we launched BGP log support, we supported what is called tunnel activity logs.  If you were troubleshooting connectivity issues resulting from either an Internet Key Exchange or peer detection, you could rely on tunnel activity logs.  I have a couple of examples of messages that are helpful if you are specifically diagnosing authentication-related issues.

[![Thumbnail 1580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1580)

However, if none of these are the reasons behind your VPN connectivity issues, your next option is to look at BGP logs. What happened previously was that customers needed to create a support ticket with AWS to get insights or visibility into these logs. Now with our BGP log support, you can self-serve these logs and build your own automation  around them as you see fit. At a high level, there are two types of BGP logs or messages that you will see in your BGP logs.  One is messages relating to your BGP session status, and the other is related to your routing updates.

When it comes to BGP status messages, it will provide you information around things like prefix limit violations, if you are hitting any limits, or changes in the status of your connections, such as the session moving to idle. With your routing updates, you can get the BGP attributes, such as AS path, next hop IP addresses, MED values, and weight of your prefixes. I hope that with BGP logs now, it becomes much easier and faster for you to troubleshoot any VPN connectivity-related issues.

Let me do a quick recap before we move into the final topic of the day. As I talked through all of the features today, there are three distinct themes in terms of how these capabilities simplify your remote site connectivity.  First is around security and compliance. We talked about how you can use AWS Secrets Manager integration to further enhance the security of your PSK credentials. Next, we talked about IPv6 support, and now with IPv6 support for outer tunnel IP addresses, you can truly build an end-to-end IPv6 connection. 

[![Thumbnail 1700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1700)

Then we just talked about the monitoring theme, which is essentially how you can now get BGP logs for your VPN tunnels to help you troubleshoot VPN connectivity issues faster. Finally, the third theme of the day has been simplifying connectivity.  One is VPN using VPN Concentrator. As a reminder, VPN Concentrator is geared towards customers who need to connect a large number of sites with low bandwidth requirements to access their workloads in AWS. The 5 Gbps tunnel, on the other hand, is specifically geared towards customers who need higher bandwidth throughput, and this can provide you 5 Gbps throughput per tunnel.

### AWS and eero Partnership: Introducing Reliable Cloud-Managed Networking

Now, finally, we would like to talk about how AWS and eero are working together to further simplify this remote connectivity, and I would like to invite Mark for that. Can everybody hear me? All right, great. Nishant did a great job. Another round of applause for Nishant. He has a two-week-old at home right now, and he showed up because he wanted to show everybody about everything that AWS has been building with the Concentrator and more. Thank you for making it out, Nishant. I'm Mark Sieglock, and let's go to the next slide.  I'm here today to talk to you about eero. As Nishant mentioned, we have now integrated AWS with eero, officially marrying your WAN and AWS's cloud connectivity with the LAN and everything that you have at your remote sites and branch offices. I'm going to go through both the specific integration that we've done with AWS and for those less familiar with eero, I'm going to go through some of our hardware, and after the show you can come and touch and feel the hardware as well.

I'll give out my email so if you want to test hardware in your lab and see how this functionality works, you're welcome to do so and we'll ship over equipment so that you can test it. Everything that we're going to talk about during this session is available today and in production. Thank you for spending the time with us and let's have some fun.

[![Thumbnail 1830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1830)



A quick introduction: I'm Mark Sieglock. I've been at eero for 10 years, before we had revenue and before we had our first product. Our mission from day one was to make technology in homes and businesses just work through fast, reliable, and secure connectivity. What exactly does that mean? For it to just work, it needs to be easy to use, whether it's provisioning it centrally from a managed IT and then someone getting that at a branch location just being able to plug it in and it works, or setting it up for the first time yourself.

It needs to be reliable. That reliability needs to mean if the WAN goes down, your LAN stays up. Devices roam well, and if there are radar strikes, we don't just move to busy channels. You have to be able to configure it for specific implementations as well. The connectivity needs to be really strong. The security is backed with eero by Amazon, so the Amazon security team reviews and approves all of these products, and we provide firmware updates so that the latest and greatest is always available to you in the case that there's a security patch that's needed.

Finally, it means cloud management. Everything that we've built, because we came up in 2016, we started with an API. That API means all data is exportable into your systems. We also have a web front end so that you can see all of the data and analytics yourself. We have a relentless team. A lot of you are in the audience today, but we have a relentless team that cares and goes and meets with customers, helps with installations, and goes and pushes the boundaries of what's possible.

I'm literally doing two or three troubleshooting calls a day so that I stay close to our customers and understand what's going on. Every single person from the team is expected, whether you're an engineer, a solutions architect, a product manager, or a marketing person, to troubleshoot, to go to customer sites, and to understand and listen and learn your problems. Everybody here will show up for you day in and day out.

[![Thumbnail 1980](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/1980.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=1980)



If there's one thing you take away from today, it's that eero has the most reliable networks at scale. We have tens of millions of eero devices deployed across 28 countries. We are the number one mesh system in the US. How many people here run eero? Raise your hands if you run eero. Thank you for being customers. We have the number one mesh Wi-Fi system in the US. What does that mean? It means we manage the largest distributed fleet of devices, or one of the largest distributed fleets of devices in the world.

It means we're troubleshooting and we see problems more often than others. We've kept things simple as well. We've kept Qualcomm commercial grade chips throughout our products, so when we patch a firmware issue in one, it applies to the entire fleet that you have. In the 28 countries, it means if you have a site here, a site in Canada, a site in Australia, we will support it, and it's the same hardware across all of those different countries. We just apply a slightly different software configuration. The hardware shows up and you can manage it all the same from the same dashboard, the same API, and you're not managing a ton of different SKUs for your business.

[![Thumbnail 2070](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/2070.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=2070)



### eero's Advanced Networking Capabilities and Hardware Solutions for Business

We have a lot of advanced networking capabilities. What you see if you have us at home, as many of you mentioned, is great, I set it up and it just works. But there's a lot more to it than just that. On the back end we have automatic channel selection so that we can choose the right channel. We also have the ability to custom manage or select any channels that you want or see fit.

We have all of the setup that you see in the mobile app. We also have setup and configuration from the admin panel or from APIs. If you designate a specific eero to be part of, say, an apartment complex or a larger network site, you can group them together and we'll change how the wireless performance works across those sites.

On the setup front, we spend considerable time refining the setup experience. When we first launched the company, we did what we called the grandma test over the holiday break. Every one of us had to take eero devices home and our grandmas or moms had to set up the devices. The goal was for them to get all three up and running in under 10 minutes. My grandma did it, and she had 4 devices, but she got it in 20 minutes.

We just launched another setup flow both in the mobile app and the wireless configs, and we're seeing sub-7 minute setup times with 96% first-time setup success rates, whether it's wired or wireless. We're deployed in some Amazon Go locations. We actually have 5 Guys at the Venetian Hotel here in Las Vegas. It's one of the largest 5 Guys in the world, and it runs all of the networking infrastructure. Deployments from quick-service restaurants are quite extensive. There are 6 of these devices with a ton of wired access points.

We have a Wi-Fi 7 device that is wired to all of their printers. It has static IPs for specific services and routes back to AWS for some of the stuff that they're running in the cloud because they have a pretty complicated setup. It is remarkable how many businesses are running on eero, no matter the sophistication of their deployment. We have over 100,000 businesses running on us today.

We also do events. We recently did the World Surf League, which was really fun to do. Drew, one of our solutions architects in the audience, did the World Surf League, and we ran 8 separate networks across the beach and across the food areas. We were able to provide coverage to approximately 40,000 people who were in and out of the area over a 5-day period.

[![Thumbnail 2260](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/2260.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=2260)

Now let's get to the hardware.  For setting up a remote branch or a site, we have a POE gateway. This device has 2 10-gigabit Ethernet ports, 8 2.5-gigabit Ethernet ports, and a 100-watt power budget. It can power a bunch of the Wi-Fi 7 POE access points. These support 3.9 gigabits wirelessly. They're mountable, they're POE, and they're flexible for any type of setup. The mount is compatible with the dual-band POE product that we have as well.

We also have an outdoor device. When we worked with so many multi-site retailers and businesses, we realized we couldn't just leave Wi-Fi inside. We had to take it outside too. This device is IP 66 rated, so you can effectively do anything to it except dunk it in a bucket of water. Wi-Fi is not very good in a bucket of water anyway. This is probably my favorite product that we built just because of the testing and shock testing that we had to do with it.

In addition to thermal testing with heat and cold, we actually had to do that very rapidly to make sure that the plastics or anything wouldn't break. We had to do a bunch of drop testing from higher heights than you would with a normal product, and it was really fun to build this.

Lastly, on the reliability network, we just announced and are launching here very shortly the eero Signal. This plugs in via USB-C and can plug into a gateway which supports multi-WAN. This is a cellular backup device that supports multiple carriers. Say you're in one area and the carrier that's best is Carrier A. It'll choose Carrier A. If you move to a different area and it's Carrier B, it'll choose Carrier B. We do all the eSIM management for you. We use a new protocol called SGP 32, which allows us to switch between carriers in a way that makes it seamless for you, and you don't even need to know. It's just going to choose the best signal for you wherever you place it in a specific property.

The other thing that's really cool about this is because we manage all these large distributed networks, you don't have to place this with your modem.

Usually a modem or an ONT is plugged in directly to this, and then you put your other cellular device with that, but that oftentimes is in a rack, and that rack doesn't necessarily have good signal to it because it's in a closet somewhere. This can go anywhere in the network, plug into any of the eeros on your mesh, and then when the main modem goes down, this device will pick up the signal, take over as the gateway, and then propagate the signal throughout the mesh.

We used a lot of the work that we had done on flexible deployments and wireless to make that product possible. All of this works with the same connectivity stack that I talked about earlier. It all works with what we call internally true channel, which is where we select the right channels in the clear spectrum. It works with something we've patented called progressive DFS, and so if you're using DFS channels and a radar strike hits, instead of shrinking the channel or moving off of DFS into something that's noisy, we actually shrink the channel width and keep you there so it's clean spectrum, and then we move off later if we see another radar strike.

There's so much more that we do there as well. We also do unified firmware updates across all of these devices, and the unified firmware updates make it so that when you're troubleshooting, you don't have to say, "Well, this site has this firmware, this site has this firmware, this site has this firmware—which bug do I have in each one?" and manage that yourself. The way we've been able to scale to tens of millions of eeros is we've standardized that.

[![Thumbnail 2540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/2540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=2540)

Now we want to standardize that, but we have to earn the right to standardize that. What we do is provide flexibility of when those deployments will be pushed out. We have to provide a lot of clarity into bugs. We have to provide a lot of testing time. We have to make sure that the quality bar of every incremental release is extremely high so that you can deploy that to customers quickly or to your own sites.

As I mentioned a bit earlier, everything that we do—our hardware and the connectivity layer—it's all cloud-based and API first. We launched in 2016, and that was when the cloud was front and center.  We run everything on AWS, and all of the data that you can see in Insight is exportable into your system not only via API in real time but  also via all the data systems. I'll get into a little bit later the data integrations we do with AWS, but you could export every layer from the streaming data layer into S3 via S3 replication and via Kinesis streaming as well.  You can sit on top of Kinesis, CloudWatch, or if you have someone who just wants to come in and check stuff out real quick, you can do all of that in our web-based dashboard as well for each  of your sites or across sites. We have both a network-specific level view and a network group view, so you can see multiple networks that are on the same site,  or a fleet level view across your entire organization.

[![Thumbnail 2620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/2620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=2620)

Why did we even do this? Everybody's like, "Oh, I rent you in my home. Why did you do this?"  Honestly, it wasn't the top priority for us. Customers kept deploying us and buying our products because everything that they had looked like that picture on the right. It was really hard to manage. They were doing everything with static or manual configuration. The hardware was extremely expensive, it didn't scale to all their sites. They were managing BGP and other stuff all manually, and a lot of times the firmware was out of date.

[![Thumbnail 2690](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/2690.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=2690)

What we saw was customers deploying us and buying us on Eero.com or on Amazon.com, and we actually had about 50 to 10,000 businesses deploying our product before we invested in features for them. Then we thought, "There's something here," and we've dedicated a giant team to go after this opportunity and really earn your business. We've done, as I mentioned earlier, over 100,000 business deployments to different site types since we started that investment a few years ago. 

### Seamless AWS Integration with eero: Site-to-Site VPN Configuration and Management

Let's go a little bit into AWS and eero and how we merge things together. You can technically put any device as a gateway, but you put this as the gateway at the site. There's about two clicks, one click to link your AWS account to eero, and a second click to set up your VPN.

You can connect your VPN via Transit Gateway or via Cloud WAN, and then you're essentially done with what you do in eero. After that, you can manage everything else in AWS. You can land everything in a specific VPC, set up firewall rules, and do much more in AWS if you want to do things locally.

eero supports VLANs, or virtual LANs. We support access control lists, or ACLs, that can run locally. We support specific DNS configurations, and we can even do some DNS on-premises with you and set up different applications on-premises if you have things that you need of that nature. Alternatively, you could run it through AWS. No matter how large your sites scale, we can work with you to find the right solution for what you want to do locally, where you want to set those firewall rules, and what you want to run in your cloud, ensuring that it meets your needs from a cost perspective, a performance perspective, a security perspective, and from simplified overhead and operational management.

We support a lot of the things that were covered today. We support everything from IPv4 to IPv6 integrations and more. We can get you details if you're interested in deploying our products to your specific branches or locations. On a specific site, we support up to roughly 50 devices in a specific network, and then you have to scale by having separated logical networks. Today that's growing rapidly because of the number of deployments we have, and we've seen a lot of deployments to restaurant chains, department stores, and I was actually just in Australia doing a boutique hotel. They ripped out some very old gear, about 15 years old, put ours in, and they said it just worked. They didn't really believe it was going to work when we first put it in, which is pretty great.

[![Thumbnail 2860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/2860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=2860)



I'm going to talk a little bit more about what we do with site-to-site VPN, security, and analytics. One thing I didn't mention is that we have advanced routing with BGP, so we support that today, as well as static routing options. We have multi-region deployment support as well. On the security side, you get access to everything from DDoS protection to TLS certificates, based on our implementation with AWS. On the analytics side, we've integrated everything that we have with AWS. I mentioned earlier that you can get all of your data that eero replicated in your own S3 instance. You can set alerts via CloudWatch on top of Kinesis data streams, or if you want something simpler, you can set up all those alerts in Insight and in our tools itself.

[![Thumbnail 2940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/2940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=2940)



Here are a few screenshots of exactly what we're doing and how to do it. This is the bulk configuration and the specific alerts you can set for your access points, for your overall network, and so on. All of this exists today. If you get access to our hardware after the show today, we'll provision you and you can set all of this up yourself. You can set up your entire organization or sub-organizations. Some of the cool things that we do include partnering with over 100 Internet Service Providers across the globe today. Actually, 60 percent of our business is deployed through large ISPs.

[![Thumbnail 2970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/2970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=2970)



You can go and set up your organization. You can set up sub-organizations. We scale multi-tenancy to multiple organizations. If we sold to an MSP, or managed service provider, that was managing one region, say you're across five continents and you have five MSPs across those continents, you could provide the MSP access to the networks they need, and then you could also manage it centrally yourself with your own configurations.

[![Thumbnail 3000](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/3000.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=3000)



You can provide people the access they need while still having central management capabilities.

[![Thumbnail 3020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/3020.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=3020)

[![Thumbnail 3030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/3030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=3030)

We support SSO and all the role-based access controls and everything that you need in a general enterprise tool. We talked a little bit about  dual WAN and multi-WAN, so you can connect multiple WAN sources. If you have one circuit  and another to the same site, you can pull those in. It can be connected to the same gateway or to multiple gateways that you have throughout your site for resiliency and reliability. You can configure it directly in the interface or via API across all of your different sites.

[![Thumbnail 3060](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/d45bc540f1e3cc8d/3060.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt5IwPVnSnw&t=3060)

Here's a snippet of the site-to-site VPN implementation that we worked on with Nishant and how simple it is to  really connect to AWS. There's not much to it.  My email is Mark, M-A-R-K@eo.com. Email me if you want hardware, if you want to test, if you want to try out the products, if you want us to do a site visit and figure out what your topology should look like, or if you want to replace old networking gear at a different site.

I'm here today to tell you about eero and to make sure that you know we have a team that is relentlessly working to improve your Internet experience at your sites and to help you improve connectivity for all your employees and all of your customers across the globe. Thank you very much for your time. I'm Mark. Nice to meet you.
