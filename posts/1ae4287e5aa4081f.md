### The Shift from Product Procurement to Solution-Based Buying on AWS Marketplace

 Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for joining this session on solution selling on AWS Marketplace. I'm delighted to talk to you about this topic. Ajay and I are working for the Marketplace team. Before we start, I'd like to share with you a personal story that's happening with me right now.

[![Thumbnail 20](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/20.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=20)

 I need to rebuild my kitchen at home, and I'm not really too sure how to go about it. I've got several options. I can either buy the furniture myself, all the appliances, the cabinets, build everything myself, and start from scratch. My second option would be to go to a contractor and get the contractor to put together all the appliances and the cabinets I've bought. The third option could be to go to a company that would just build everything as per my specs.

So why am I talking about my kitchen here? The reason is the type of questioning I'm doing with myself right now is something that thousands of customers are going through as they procure solutions for their needs in the cloud. What we want to talk about today is this trend, how do you make these decisions and how do you move towards an environment where you can move to actually getting the solutions that you need.

[![Thumbnail 80](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/80.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=80)

 So before we talk about this, I just want to give a bit of an overview of what AWS Marketplace is for those of you that may not be completely familiar. AWS Marketplace is a comprehensive catalog of over 30,000 listings. We cover over 70 categories of products and we have over 6,000 sellers today. This is a global marketplace. We're covering over six currencies today, and this is a very powerful tool.

It provides a range of benefits, including the fact that you can get flexible pricing. It's a very standardized and repeatable procurement process. This is also a great tool to help streamline vendor management as a buyer. This marketplace has served customers really well, specifically those that are interested in maintaining direct procurement relationships with the vendors and want to purchase products individually. But what we are seeing today is that there's a shift in the market and expectations of customers are changing.

[![Thumbnail 150](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/150.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=150)

 In the past, technical teams would identify products that they needed. They would evaluate features. They would work on the actual integration work to piece together solutions corresponding to the products they needed, and this worked well when companies at the time had the expertise to create these solutions themselves. Today's landscape is really different. Business buyers are increasingly involved in technology decisions, and they want to focus on outcomes.

They are interested in getting things that correspond to their needs. They are asking themselves questions such as how do I modernize my contact center operations. So this is really about focusing on outcomes. This shift that we are seeing is even accelerating faster with AI. Customers that are going on Marketplace typically don't know the specific products they need to procure. They come with an outcome in mind and they want to get the solutions that correspond to it.

So when you start thinking of solution selling, you need to start piecing together multiple products and services together. That can be software solutions, professional services. This is the topic that we want to talk to you about today. This is this shift that we want to try to address. This sort of environment is really what you can see in a range of these cases. When customers are looking to procure solutions, they want to purchase observability and monitoring solutions, they want to move towards GenAI transformation. They are seeking solutions. They are seeking outcomes.

### Introducing Multi-product Solutions: A New Marketplace Capability

 Alright, so we are very excited to have made available this week on AWS Marketplace a new feature called Multi-product Solutions. This is a significant evolution in the way marketplace addresses sellers and buyers and making sure that they can address the solutions and the outcomes that they need. For the first time, customers can purchase together multiple products from different categories, so you can combine software solutions, professional services, all in one single transaction.

This is about fundamentally simplifying the buying journey for customers and streamlining the sales motion. For customers, instead of having to discover, evaluate, and procure individual products, they can now have access to comprehensive solutions corresponding to their needs. For partners, this is about selling the way their customers want to buy, presenting complete solutions while making sure that they can benefit from all the kind of touring that they've come to expect from AWS Marketplace.

So what does that mean for partners that are leveraging this new capability?

[![Thumbnail 320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=320)

 There are three main shifts. The first one is about the transformation this means in terms of their go-to-market. With multi-product solutions, you evolve from procuring individual products to being able to get complete solutions. What that means as well is that you can move from generic products to actually targeting very specific use case and industry solutions. So you can really start to tailor how you appear on marketplace to make sure that you meet the needs of your customers.

It's also about bringing in scale. What buyers and sellers tell us is that every transaction on Marketplace is different. So we've engineered the features so that it's very easy to tailor the solution as you go through the sales cycle, meaning that as you purchase a solution through multi-product solutions, you can add components, remove components, swap components very easily through the sales cycle.

Finally, it's about streamlining procurement. So it's about combining the benefits of the marketplace with the facility of being able to procure entire solutions, and this is the topic that we want to bring together today. An important point when you procure through these multi-product solutions is that every product within the solution maintains its own terms and pricing, so we have a lot of flexibility in terms of creating and constructing the solutions in a way that makes sense.

### How Multi-product Solutions Work: From Creation to Purchase

Alright, so enough talking about the future. I want now to hand over the floor to Asha, who's going to walk you through a specific example of how this works. Thank you, Vincent. Now that you understand the key benefits, let me demonstrate to you how multi-product solutions will work in a real

[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=430)

 life scenario. I have an example here from two of our launch partners, Accenture and Elastic. Accenture has created a data readiness engine for Gen AI solution that's available on our marketplace website. The solution combines four products. It has Elastic Cloud for semantic and vector search. It has Elastic MCP server to enable natural language interaction. Accenture Aspire connectors for large-scale data ingestion, and Accenture data to knowledge implementation service for deployment and ongoing services.

This is a solution that will help organizations prepare proprietary data at scale for Gen AI production workloads. So let me show you the lifecycle of the solution and how a partner like Accenture can create the solution, how a customer can discover the solution on our website, how Accenture can then customize the solution based on the customer's needs, and finally how the customer can procure the solution. So on to step one.

[![Thumbnail 510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=510)

 So in order to create a solution, a partner such as Accenture would come to the Partner Central website. They click on solutions in the left navigation and hit create solution. Creating a solution happens in four simple and easy steps. In step one, you will provide basic details such as the solution name, the solution description, the logo, and so on.

Step two is where you add all the products that you want to be included in the solution. This can be products that you have or products from other partners. Going back to the Accenture example, this is where they add two products from Elastic and they add two of their own products.

In step three, you will proceed to add the use cases. Adding the use cases is an important part of solution creation because this is how you customize your solution and make it stand out in the Gen AI search capabilities, for example. If your solution is catered to the healthcare industry or financial industry, or if you're catering to a niche area in the security space, this is the space for you to add all the use cases so that it surfaces when a customer searches with those keywords.

Finally, you will click on create solution. You can also add promotional media and other details. You have an option to preview the solution to see how it looks on the buyer web when a buyer looks for it,

and if you're satisfied, you can go ahead and publish your solution. Publishing your solution will make it publicly discoverable on the marketplace website to thousands of customers. So let's see what happens with the solution next when it's published on our website.

[![Thumbnail 630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=630)

 A buyer comes to the marketplace website and they can discover solutions in a few different ways. First, they can use the agentic mode that was just announced, and they can type in their use cases and requirements, and we will surface all the solutions that match their needs. Another option is they can use the search and filtering capabilities to find the solution they need. If you observe, we have introduced a new filter on the left-hand side for multi-products, which is how they can discover solutions that have multiple products in them.

Once a customer discovers a solution, they can click on it, which will take them to the details page of the solution. It shows them details such as the description, use cases, and the products included. The customer also sees what products are deployed on AWS versus not, and they also see details of how these products integrate or work together. If this is the solution they need, they click on request private offer.

[![Thumbnail 710](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/710.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=710)

[![Thumbnail 740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/740.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=740)

Clicking on the request private offer button  will generate an AWS-originated opportunity to the seller, who is Accenture in this case. The next step is for a partner to put together a package of private offers, which we call the offer set. Each component of the solution has its own private offer, and everything is wrapped around in an offer set. So the partner would go to the AWS Marketplace  Management Portal, which is where you go today to create private offers.

You'll see a new tab which says private offer set, and you'll click on create offer set. You'll then go on to add individual offers for each product that is part of the solution. This is where the flexibility comes into play that Vincent was talking about. You can customize the pricing terms, EULA, and duration for each product in the offer set.

For example, you can have a SaaS product with a payment schedule. You can have a professional services product with milestone-based billing or variable payment. You can have another SaaS product with pay-as-you-go pricing and so on. Once you as a partner have put together the complete offer set, you will publish the offer set to the buyer. Clicking the button to publish is what makes the offer set available to a buyer.

[![Thumbnail 810](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/810.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=810)

 The buyer or customer will receive an email saying an offer set is available for them to purchase. When they click on that, it takes them to the marketplace console website, which is where they go today to purchase private offers. This is the view that I, as a customer, will see when I go to purchase an offer set. It shows me all the individual products or components that are part of the offer set. It gives me the breakdown of prices for each of the offers, but it also gives me a total cost.

For example, if I'm trying to get approval from my organization for the data readiness engine, I can get an approval for the total cost, but I also know what each of the individual pieces will cost by themselves. Once I have reviewed each component of the offer set, I click accept offer set. It then takes me to a confirmation page where I can go on to deploy my software.

[![Thumbnail 880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=880)

[![Thumbnail 890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=890)

For example, the MCP server can be deployed   on AWS. I can deploy my MCP server on Agent Core for SaaS. I can go on to the partner website to create credentials and so on. Also, all the agreements that are created are tagged back to this offer set ID

so that at any point in the life cycle I can come back and see all the purchases I've made for the data readiness engine. So that concludes the life cycle of a solution.

### Launch Partners and Getting Started with Multi-product Solutions

Now on to the most important slide,  some of our launch partners. We couldn't have gotten to this point without you, so first of all, I want to take a moment to thank all of you if you're here in the room for being awesome partners and collaborating with us. We've seen very strong momentum since we announced this feature. We already have 70 solutions on our marketplace website from 65 launch partners.

For example, we have some of our ISVs who have combined their own products and services, such as Mistral AI, Trend Micro, and Okta. All of these partners have created solutions on our website that bring together their own products and services. We have a lot of system integrators and channel partners who have created industry-specific solutions that showcase their expertise.

For example, we have solutions from SHI and Westcon, which bring together CrowdStrike and Zscaler, two of our security partners. We also have four partners who have put together contact center solutions using Amazon Connect. So go onto our website and take a look at all of those great solutions that we have out there.

[![Thumbnail 1010](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1ae4287e5aa4081f/1010.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TotVxOC44&t=1010)

 If you click on that first QR code, it'll take you to our marketplace website and you can see the 70 solutions I spoke about. You can also see the data readiness solution from Accenture and some of the others that I just mentioned in this presentation. If you are a partner who's not yet created a solution, click on that second QR code because you'll get all the material you need that teaches you how to create your own solution on AWS Marketplace.

If you're an enterprise buyer and you're wondering how do I find all these solutions and how do I purchase, click on that third QR code and it has all the details on how you can purchase a solution. And with that, we are at the end of our presentation. Thank you so much. Hope you enjoyed it.
