### The Testing Crisis and LambdaTest's Intent-Driven Solution with KaneAI and HyperExecute

 Hi, everyone. I'm Shantanu Wali. I'm a Director of Product Management at LambdaTest, and I'm really excited to talk about scaling automation with KaneAI and HyperExecute. Before we begin, I want to discuss the problems with testing strategies today. While we all understand there are many challenges, a few key ones I want to highlight are fragmented oversight, disconnected testing processes that lead to blind spots, and a lack of centralized governance that causes misalignment across teams.

[![Thumbnail 20](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/20.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=20)

 The second major problem is inconsistent testing standards. This brings variability across teams, which weakens quality, causes delays, and erodes customer trust when something is shipped that isn't exactly as it was supposed to be. Finally, there's a big problem that persists: brittle, unscalable infrastructure. Legacy systems cannot meet modern testing needs, and they end up slowing down innovation.

If we dig deeper into why testing is breaking right now, we'll find that most of the time quality engineers and developer teams focusing on testing imagine they should be spending on test planning and authoring is not actually being done. Test planning and authoring is just the tip of the iceberg. What we actually see is that most time is spent fixing broken and flaky tests. A lot of time is spent on test optimization, test execution, and monitoring. Even right now, a lot of time is going into triaging and debugging tests.

[![Thumbnail 70](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/70.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=70)

We all know that generative AI is reshaping engineering in today's world. Over the last couple of years, we've seen a huge code volume surge, and that code volume surge also needs to be tested. So the question is: is testing ready for it?  That's where LambdaTest comes in with a modern, intent-driven testing workflow. Essentially, what we're doing with KaneAI and HyperExecute at the center is allowing you to plan your tests and author your tests leveraging KaneAI, and of course execute them by leveraging HyperExecute, while giving you all the analysis as well.

[![Thumbnail 120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=120)

The major question many of you might be asking is whether this is only for functional testing. The answer is no. It can be functional testing, API testing, accessibility, visual regression, and performance testing, because that's how you'll meet your modern testing needs.  The way it works is that you can input any requirement you might have, which could be via media, video, or audio files. It could be a complete PRD document that you want to upload, or it could be requirements coming directly from Jira stories. All of that goes into KaneAI, which gets all the context and memory added to it and gives out relevant test cases to you.

Those test cases, while having a human in the loop, are then authored autonomously by KaneAI agents. All of that can be executed on the HyperExecute platform. The output leverages open source frameworks and languages, including Selenium, Playwright, and Appium, executing and giving you all the analysis and root cause analyses that might be helpful for you to figure out the best code coverage and finally achieve that in-sprint automation that everybody would like to do. All of that very seamlessly plugs back into your Jira workflows through that connection, with more than 100 integrations already in place.

### Live Demo: Autonomous Test Generation and Authoring from Jira to Execution

One great part of it is that all of this works on intent. It's completely natural language based, which allows you to move at light speed and much faster as well. Now I would like to show it all to you in action.  We're going to switch to a demo mode. What we have here is a Jira story, and I've taken an example of Airbnb right here. This would be something that many of us might get when we're developing any feature or any requirements that might have come from the product team.  Once we have those details available, what KaneAI can do is allow us to add a comment such as "LambdaTest AI Cloud, generate test scenarios for me." As soon as I enter that, KaneAI will quickly analyze the description, the summary, and any other custom field that you might want.  Within a few seconds, it will come back with a response saying, "Great! I have gone through the entire context that you have provided, and I'm starting to generate the relevant test scenarios that you want."  If you just go ahead and click on that link, 

[![Thumbnail 310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=310)

[![Thumbnail 320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=320)

[![Thumbnail 330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=330)

we'll see that all the information initially provided  to us has been figured out by KaneAI and it has started generating test scenarios and multiple test cases within them as well, giving you all the relevant information  whether the test case is a must-have, whether the scenarios that have been generated are positive scenarios, negative scenarios, or edge cases. Something that you would have spent a couple of days going through to figure out what scenarios and test cases you want to automate, KaneAI helps you do that in seconds with all the relevant context of your application. 

[![Thumbnail 360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=360)

Now, one great thing that I also want to talk about is that if you have existing test cases, it also checks for deduplication and does not create duplicate tests every single time. It saves a lot of your time by ensuring that it has existing test cases in context as well. Now, what we can do is we can actually quickly go ahead and see what details have been created, and these are complete information that would be relevant for you to have your test cases ready, including test steps, outcomes, and of course we have added the flow in a manner that we can have human in the loop. 

[![Thumbnail 390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=390)

[![Thumbnail 400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=400)

Anyone can ensure that they are able to review it, make edits to it, and make any changes to the test steps as well, and go ahead and review those quickly. Once all of them make sense, the goal is not just to be able to go ahead and create these test cases.  The goal is to be able to automate them in a singular flow itself. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select a few of the test cases and I'm going to go ahead and create an automate. 

[![Thumbnail 440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=440)

Now the beauty of it all is that it's completely platform agnostic. Whether you have a web application, whether you have a mobile native application or a hybrid application, or whether it's just a mobile browser app that you want to go ahead and test, you can choose any of these, upload your relevant apps, whether it's APKs, IPAs, provide us the URL, or even if it's a local application that you want to go ahead and test out, you can go ahead and do that as well. 

[![Thumbnail 460](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/460.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=460)

Finally, let's say I input the application under test, which would be Airbnb.com in my case. And let me just choose a few agents and go ahead and create an automate. Now as soon as I do that, KaneAI will spin up multiple agents in the background to autonomously author these test cases, and we can see all of them are coming up right now, right here. 

[![Thumbnail 510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=510)

So what we see is that multiple test cases got authored and they autonomously ran within the session and the output that we get at the end is something such as this, that they are providing you the entire context, the entire test cases, and every piece of information which might be relevant to you. So for example, it actually went ahead and searched for an accommodation, figured out every step, and all of this is intent natural language driven. 

[![Thumbnail 520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=520)

Now why I'm highlighting this again and again, why intent driven is necessary, is because the problems that we were talking about initially when we started out—being flaky tests, flaky locators, triaging and debugging—all of that comes into context when you have that information available to you, and that information comes as intent to the system. Now what you can see here is complete details along with screenshots which might be relevant to you, highlighting what exactly KaneAI is doing where it's going ahead and performing the test for you. 

[![Thumbnail 530](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/530.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=530)

[![Thumbnail 540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=540)

And as an output what you also get is the complete code of it as well. You get a complete open source code whether it's Selenium, whether it's Playwright, Cypress, or WebDriver IO. You can choose any open source framework and language which might be relevant to you and your team might be more comfortable with.  

[![Thumbnail 550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=550)

[![Thumbnail 560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/560.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=560)

And then another thing that I do want to highlight, as I was mentioning earlier, it's not just about functional test. You can go ahead and have your API testing, curl commands, assertions on nested JSON values, and all the best practices that are already out there from decades of experiences that people have had in testing strategies can actually be leveraged right here itself.  

[![Thumbnail 580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=580)

[![Thumbnail 590](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/590.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=590)

Now what I also want to show you, which is really brilliant, is that while authoring the test case, KaneAI and I actually figured out that there are a few issues that are already there within the system. So for example, if I just open one of them, what it was expecting was that the map should be present and enabled above the listing.  However, if you just open the screenshot quickly, what we see is the map is actually beside the listing that we see here. So it has gone ahead and suggested as a bug that the actual outcome was that the map is present but it's not above the listings page.  Now that is something which only an AI will be able to figure out quickly and give you that result.

[![Thumbnail 610](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/610.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=610)

You can directly confirm and raise a bug on Jira and give it to your relevant developers and team members to have an extremely easy, smooth flow  within the same system. Of course, you can manage your entire test cases and all the details which might be relevant to you. Now, what we've done until now is just seen how multiple test cases are authored and automated. We have automation scripts ready for them, but that's not all. That's not what we want to do.

[![Thumbnail 650](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/650.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=650)

[![Thumbnail 660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/660.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=660)

### Test Execution Analysis, Root Cause Diagnostics, and Performance Reporting with HyperExecute

We want to go ahead and bulk them out, maybe create a test suite, maybe create a regression or sanity suite, and finally integrate them into CI pipelines as well because that's how development works for us. So what you can do is club all of the test cases together into something called test runs . If I just open one of the test runs that I've already run very recently, just a few hours ago, we'll see that we get complete results and  all the analysis that might be required for us. We do see that it has a 70.3% pass rate, the total duration it took, and finally what we give out to you in case of failures is whether it was a new kind of failure that has come up now, whether it's an anomaly in terms of test execution time, maybe a network call was taking much longer than it was expecting to take, or maybe it's a test which is always failing, which might need some help.

[![Thumbnail 700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=700)

If we just click on what the issue was, we actually see a complete RCA, a root cause analysis for how many times the error has been repeated, what is the overall error trends, what exactly failed right there, and  if needed, any remediation strategies that might be required. Now all of this comes in from HyperExecute by analyzing all your historical data as well and any executions that you might have. The great part here is that you can also schedule your test runs apart from integrating these to CI pipelines as well. So in case you want to just go ahead and have a sanity run every single day, every morning at 9 o'clock, you can go ahead and schedule that.

[![Thumbnail 760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=760)

Once you come back to any results, what you'll also see is a complete report. If I just switch to this report section of the historical runs that have happened, we can see that these are a few runs that are scheduled and are happening recently. We can see what is the overall stability of my suite, whether it's running consistently or not, whether there's any decline, what is the pass fail rate overall that it has been running over a period of time, and what are the failure categories, whether it's failing at a particular step, whether it's automation, whether it is a product issue or whether it's an environment issue because that's a huge problem when we're trying to debug as to what is going on and what might the concerns be. 

[![Thumbnail 780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=780)

[![Thumbnail 790](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/790.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=790)

What I do want to show you is that if we go ahead into any of the details, let's say something did fail, and this is not enough information for us, we want to dig  deep, we want to see more. We can just click on any of the test cases that we see right here and be navigated to a complete details for you along with a video  along with all the command logs, all the relevant information that you might need in order to debug the test including the network calls and an accessibility report as well.

[![Thumbnail 820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=820)

[![Thumbnail 830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=830)

[![Thumbnail 840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=840)

Now this is something which is extremely critical as of right now because accessibility is something that everybody is focusing on and needs to focus on right now. So you can get your full fledged report using any specific WCAG version, figure out what if there are any critical issues or  serious concerns that you need to get fixed quickly and see a full fledged report as well. Of course, if you're talking about mobile devices and real devices, you get a complete app performance report as well  for your performance testing whether you want to figure out a cold startup time, hot startup time, check how your application is performing over a period of test session, whether  it's a peak in CPU usage, whether your application is actually degrading the performance of the device, and eventually giving you slow results on a real device because that's something that you cannot find on simulator remotely or directly. Memory usage, disk usage, and all of that information which might be relevant to you.

[![Thumbnail 870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=870)

[![Thumbnail 910](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/7da10d2c50118f23/910.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p5t4m6Twl4&t=910)

I know that we've gone through a lot of information, but what I do want to highlight and just quickly recap is that  LambdaTest is helping us provide modern intent driven testing and the only way we can move forward is by ensuring that we're able to capture issues much faster and hence release faster as well. Now LambdaTest has flexible deployment models on AWS and we're listed on AWS Marketplace as well. I really want to thank all of you for attending this session. We are available at booth 679, and if you have any questions, I'd be happy to help out. If you want a customized demo, we can try out your applications directly on KaneAI as well and see how that works out for you. Thank you so much, everyone.
