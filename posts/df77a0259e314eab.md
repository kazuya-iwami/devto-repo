### Introduction: The Critical Role of Data in Digital Transformation

Good morning and welcome to Reinvent, welcome to Vegas. Thank you so much for being here. I see some of you are attending your third session today, which is fantastic. I really appreciate everyone who decided to come to this session to kick things off. Let me introduce myself. My name is Carlos Carús, and I'm head of technology for Amazon Web Services. I've been with the company for about 12 years now, and I focus on business applications with a strong emphasis on SAP. 

Today, I also have Gustav Hilding with me. He's coming from one of our nicest customers in Europe, Axford. Everything I say represents the theory, what AWS says. Everything he says represents the reality, the voice of the customer. If you want to spend more time listening to him than to me, that makes total sense. That's how you'll get real ideas and value out of this session.

[![Thumbnail 80](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/80.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=80)

Our agenda is quite straightforward.  First, we'll discuss what data matters and why data is such a big deal, particularly on AWS. Then we'll look at the products available on AWS from SAP, from third parties, and from ourselves that you can leverage to get the most value out of your data. We'll examine SAP products, AWS products, and third-party products to give you the complete picture. After that, we'll explore best practices and reference architectures to help you understand what's possible. Finally, Gustav and I will spend time discussing his journey, how he's dealing with data strategy in his company, and what's making him more competitive and innovative in the market.

[![Thumbnail 130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/130.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=130)

[![Thumbnail 150](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/150.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=150)

Let's start with the first topic: what data matters.  Spoiler alert: data matters a lot. Data is the foundation for everything you can do to be more innovative in the market. It's tightly related to the business outcomes we're all looking for. When we talk to customers, we find a sweet spot with those who want to be innovative, who want to break the status quo, and who want to think outside the box. They don't want to do what everyone else is doing; they want to do something different. 

When we're fortunate enough to talk to these customers, we work together on how to make them more successful, more competitive, and more innovative. We help them break the rules and get ahead of their competitors in the market. Usually, all these things start with a topic you've been hearing for the last 10 to 15 years: digital transformation. Companies want to transform themselves to be digital. We ran a survey a while ago, and 90 percent of customer respondents told us they're struggling to understand and respond to their customer needs. Nine out of ten said they're struggling to get real insight into their customers to give them what they're looking for.

[![Thumbnail 240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/240.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=240)

[![Thumbnail 260](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/260.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=260)

The funny thing in that same survey was that 45 percent said they've completed their digital transformation.  Something doesn't add up here. If nine out of ten are telling me they're struggling to understand their customers and struggling to get the proper data to see what's going on with their customers and what they're looking for, but four or even five out of ten are telling me their digital transformation is over, something is not working. There's something missing. 

When talking to some people, they say digital transformation is digital, and suddenly it becomes something the IT department handles, something the CIO will take care of. They say, "I don't care because I'm running the business." That's a problem because it isolates companies. Other customers tell us transformation is a 12-month project and they'll complete their digital transformation in 12 months. But technology moves so fast and advances so rapidly that transformation, in our belief, is something that will never stop. It's an ongoing effort we need to push to make sure we stay ahead of the curve and take advantage of all the beautiful new technology and solutions coming our way.

[![Thumbnail 290](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/290.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=290)

Then there's this other topic: IT and the business.  This is IT, and this is the business, and that's wrong by default. Have you ever heard a CFO say that's finance and that's the business? They don't think about it that way. Or someone from marketing saying, "I'm doing marketing, I'm not doing business." But for whatever reason, in many companies, there's this separation where IT is treated as distinct from the business.

[![Thumbnail 320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=320)

[![Thumbnail 330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=330)

IT is treated like a cost center, and then there's the business, which is totally wrong. At the end of the day, if you're working in IT, IT is the fuel of the business. IT is the part of the organization that really makes things happen.  And also, IT, if managed properly, is able to change the business. It's the part of the company that is able to look  behind corners. It's the part of the business that is able to identify patterns, detect trends, be ahead of the curve, forecast what is going to happen, and be ready to really generate new revenue streams, new business, and new value.

[![Thumbnail 350](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/350.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=350)

[![Thumbnail 360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=360)

That's the kind of things that IT is able to do for the business. Why? Because it's very simple: IT  is the business. And not only that, it's not only that IT is the business, it's that data is the fuel of IT.  Data is IT. IT is the business. The data that you are getting, that you're gathering, is what is driving the business. Imagine your companies suddenly don't have access to the data. You don't have access to information. Could your business work? Maybe yes, I don't know. I would struggle to see many companies, even ourselves, being able to run our business if we don't have the data.

[![Thumbnail 410](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/410.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=410)

### Understanding Customer Challenges and the Need for Speed in Data Access

That's why it's so important to really have a clear view on what we're going to do with the data that we are generating. What is our data strategy? Because having a proper data strategy is what is going to give us the proper foundation to really start securing things that will make us more competitive in the market, therefore to have a better and stronger business. When we're talking to customers and they talk about the challenges that they  see with SAP, or what they're looking for when they're looking at data on SAP, some of the things that you are telling us is that you need to feel clear. You need to have this need for having speed in the way you're able to consume data.

It's not that you need to wait for a whole week for this report to come to you and see what happened during the previous week. You need to have real-time information. You need to have better visibility on your projects, on your processes. You really need to understand what's going on right now so you can take better informed decisions. You need to have control of your data, everything that is happening, so then you can use this data to feed new technologies. You're probably coming here to reinvent, and you're going to hear the term generative AI, agentic AI, agentic systems many times. All these things, if you want them to be valuable for you, you need to feed them with your data.

[![Thumbnail 480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=480)

And also, you need to make sure that this data is controlled, is secure, is accessible, and is ready to be used by the people that want to use it in the way they need to use it, but only for those people that can use it and access it. And then people tell me, okay, but why AWS?  So all of these things that you see out there, forget about them. I mean, they are there. They are totally right. I mean, it's like we have strong integrations with SAP. We work with third parties and state-of-the-art technology. The thing that's really important, and that's something that I want you to remember, is the value that AWS can provide to you.

Together, you and our teams can start defining what is the real or the most valuable solution for you. We have an incredible team of solutions architects and experts that really know every single thing about how the data works within the SAP world, with BDC and AWS native solutions, third parties like Databricks and Snowflake. Having this conversation with you is what is going to make the difference. I guarantee you something: if you came here just looking for this silver bullet about what you should be doing with your data management on SAP, sorry folks, there's no silver bullet.

[![Thumbnail 550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=550)

[![Thumbnail 570](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/570.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=570)

What we can do with you is craft and build your silver bullet for yourself to meet your needs and be more efficient and competitive in the market. So many customers already  are using AWS to run their SAP workloads. Thousands of customers from many different industries, from many different places, with many different use cases, all of them totally different from one another, and all of them using their own solution for their own needs. When talking about data, there are three main patterns.  Imagine that's the kind of way of looking at things, right? Some customers are telling us, you know what, I'm really enjoying all the SAP solutions, and I really want to go with BDC. That's great. That's beautiful. Use it nice, and you have all the solutions there.

Some others are telling us, you know what, I mean, SAP, we have the information there, but I want to use the AWS native solutions. You have a plethora of beautiful solutions, enterprise great open source solutions that you can start using with the security and the safety that you know AWS is providing this layer of enterprise superiority on top of them. That's great. That's fine.

[![Thumbnail 630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=630)

Some others are telling us they want to go with third-party tools. They really love Databricks. They really love Snowflake. They want to integrate with them. That's good too. What I can tell you is let's talk about it and find what's the best solution for you in terms of risk, cost, knowledge, skill set, and outcomes that you want to achieve. That's the value that we can provide you. 

[![Thumbnail 640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/640.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=640)

Because at the end of the day, what we really see is not that there's solution A, B, or C. It's a blend of all of them. For this particular use case, I'm going to go with this third-party solution. For this other use case, I'm going to use this AWS service. For this other use case, I'm going to stay with what SAP is already bringing because it's working pretty well. Reality is you need to adapt the technology to your needs. That's the trick here. 

[![Thumbnail 660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/660.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=660)

An example we are seeing so many times is that SAP Business Warehouse, SAP BW, is end of life in 2027. So what should I do with that? I have a very old ECC system and I want to move to HANA, and then I want to move to BDC. Do I want to do the migration from scratch and create everything new? No, there's no silver bullet. Let's try to identify what's going on. Let's identify what your challenges are and let's work together on that. 

[![Thumbnail 720](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=720)

### AWS Solutions for SAP Data: BDC, Native Services, and ISV Partnerships

An option could be staying with BDC. An option could be staying with an AWS native solution. Another option could be using third-party solutions that you already know. Let's see what's the best option that fits your needs depending on so many different angles. If we look at the SAP products that we have right now for data, we have SAP Business Data Cloud, or BDC. 

What happens if you are already using BDC? If you're using BDC on AWS, it's been running on AWS for about a year now. You are taking some functionalities that are super interesting out of the box. The first one is Graviton processors. These are custom ARM processors that we've created. They are the most price-performance processors that you can find. They are super fast, incredibly reliable, have huge bandwidth, and are super cost effective. The power consumption is lower. ARM processors have really taken the market very strongly, and using Graviton gives you incredible performance.

[![Thumbnail 820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=820)

If you're using BDC, you're already leveraging the AWS backbone, our whole network that connects systems and regions all over the world. You have this interconnectivity already there. You have the security and a strong foundation for your systems. Of course, you are using Amazon S3, one of the most famous storage systems. S3 is one of our foundation systems, one of our building blocks. All of BDC is running on top of S3. If you're already using BDC, you can take advantage of AWS advanced features that we already provide to SAP so you can enjoy them directly. 

[![Thumbnail 830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=830)

What about AWS native solutions? I can't go very technical here about open tables, Hoodie, Iceberg, and all this technical stuff.  These are incredible things. Open tables are the next big deal in the usage of data lakes. The trick here is that these are open source standards, and they are really providing the state of the art in technology. You have indexes, the ability to travel back in time, direct record access, and concurrency at maximum levels. All these things that were challenges for you with data warehouses are now being solved with these new standards.

[![Thumbnail 900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=900)

The beauty of that is if you're using AWS solutions, we are taking these tools and adding an extra layer of enterprise-grade solutions. You have the security, the performance, the stability, all these things that you're expecting from great products, but when they are given to you by AWS. The trick here is basically how do I democratize these solutions so they are very easy to use for you, leveraging the AWS systems that we already provide. Of course, we have standards and reference architectures. If you want to start using those things, there are best practices out there that are really working pretty well. Directly connecting with Amazon tools, with partner solutions, with many other things. But basically the idea here is that both  the SAP world of data and AWS can integrate very easily.

[![Thumbnail 920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=920)

We also have reference architectures developed by SAP with us. If you go to this QR code , you will access the SAP Discovery Center and see all the reference architectures that we have built together with SAP so you can select the solution that really fits your needs.

The other option involves ISV solutions. We have been working with these companies for a long time. There are several places, but the two big ones are Databricks and Snowflake. First, Databricks: you can run Databricks natively on AWS. You can use BDC with the Databricks flavor, and the beauty here is that you have all these wonderful elements of the Unity Catalog, Delta Lake, and basically all these elements that help you run your Spark workloads in a very easy way. When do you use it? Are you familiar with Databricks? Do you already have that? Let's talk and see how we can integrate it together. It's super simple.

[![Thumbnail 980](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/980.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=980)

The same applies on the other side with Snowflake . Snowflake has a beautiful product that is very easy to integrate with AWS and to integrate with our plethora of solutions on generative AI, with our LLMs, with our identical elements. So basically the idea here is so simple: let's identify what are your challenges, what is your skill set, what are the tools that you already have, what are the tools that you think you will really need? Let's talk about them and let's create the proper strategy for your needs.

[![Thumbnail 1010](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/1010.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=1010)

[![Thumbnail 1020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/1020.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=1020)

Of course, we have many partners. For instance, one example is Celebal Technologies . Celebal is a partner that is super focused on SAP and AWS, and they can do the proper assessments. If you want to go to BDC, that's the way to do it. Let's run POCs if you want, and let's move things to production. So in short, the idea here is that you don't need to have all the skills yourself. We can help you find the right partner to execute all these migrations and all these projects in a super convenient and secure way for you so we can maximize the success that is going to happen in these projects .

[![Thumbnail 1050](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/df77a0259e314eab/1050.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tgc00Rs6Yk&t=1050)

Last thing for you: summary and call to action. If you are running into a data project with SAP or non-SAP data, let's talk. We have the experts who know everything about how to work with SAP data. You want to go to BDC? That's great. We can help you. You want to go with AWS native solutions? Beautiful. You want to do a blend of all of them? That's nice. That's great. Do you want to integrate with an ISV like the ones we already discussed? Why not? Let's do it. The beautiful thing here is that we have the expertise in-house to help you succeed in these projects .

### Axfood's Journey: Leveraging SAP and AWS for Retail Innovation

With this, I told you it was going to be super high level and very fast because I think the very big deal right now, the interesting part of the session, is listening to Gustav Hilding. He's the chief architect officer of Axfood. We will introduce him in a second. So Gustav, welcome to the stage. Thank you. Very excited to be here in Vegas. Thank you, Gustav, for being here. It's not your first re:Invent at all. No, I've been to a couple of re:Invents before. I think it's my tenth time in Vegas. I thought I was here many times until he told me he's been to the tenth re:Invent in Vegas. Yes, awesome. And why don't you introduce yourself? You're working from Sweden, you're working at Axfood, one of our nicest customers and a retailer. Tell us a bit about Axfood and yourself.

Yeah, thank you. Well, Axfood is a Swedish retailer. We have around 800 stores and we serve millions of customers every week. I think we have around 25 percent of the market share of all food that's being sold in Sweden, which is quite a lot. So we're really into volumes. It's a nice company to be at. I've been there for 15 years now. I started back in 2010. I've had different responsibilities with our teams of web development, portals, and also within architecture. So the last 8 years I've been a chief technical architect at Axfood working with both SAP and AWS.

Before Axfood, I was a consultant. I was an SAP consultant, so I know my old ABAP code. I have about 20 plus years of experience there. And I know you have a pretty decent SAP footprint, right? Like a massive amount of CPUs, huge amount of memory you're using, and the ERP, so many different systems.

Our journey with SAP started over 15 years ago. Back then, we had a plethora of different systems, and we really needed harmonization. We gained a lot of business value just by introducing SAP, getting integrated data, integrated processes, and simpler ways of working instead of having multiple systems. We keep most of our data in S/4HANA, which is where we have our master data. Since we're in retail, we're running the industry solution for IS Retail as well, so we keep our articles there, the assortments, our campaigns, and a lot of our core processes really run on SAP S/4HANA.

We really need to be able to customize S/4HANA because in retail you need to customize. On top of S/4HANA, we have SAP CAR, which is the Customer Activity Repository. It has everything except the customer object. The CAR is where you have the point of sales data, so all the receipts from our stores flow into the CAR. CAR is also the place where we do more unique customizations because we plan our assortment and our promotions there as well. On top of that, we use AWS. On AWS, we have our data stack, so we build all our AI and machine learning on top of AWS, and we also build our analytical applications on AWS right now.

We get more innovation and shorter timeframes for our solutions on AWS than in SAP. You have a blend of SAP solutions and also AWS to run your data analytics and AI. We are running a lot of models for forecasts and assortment management, which is super cool stuff that has been built on top of the data systems we have built. In retail, many flows are about moving goods from point A to point B, and volumes are key for us. We're also working with fresh items, so we need to have the stuff at the right place at the right time.

We do a lot of optimizations on our forecasts and predictions on where stuff needs to be. We are running a lot of machine learning models right now. We have over 100 machine learning models in production. Around 20 of these models are just for fulfillment of stores and warehouses. By doing custom AI models, we get an accuracy that is around 30 percent better than in standard systems. Our custom-built models are definitely better because standard systems are great, especially when you have regular flows and everything is as it should be.

But when you introduce campaigns, seasons, and irregularities in your flows and deviations, that's where you can beat them by using a lot of data that we don't have in SAP. Together with the SAP data, we build better forecasts. That's one area where we do a lot of work. Another area is in our assortment planning, where it's kind of like a tug of war between different parameters. You tweak one parameter and then something else goes bad. If you lower the price for one article, something else sells less, for instance, so you get cannibalization.

We try to do simulations with AI models to get the best outcome for us and our customers and also to get good volumes flowing through our company at the right time. That's a big area for us for AI and machine learning. Also, when we're doing e-commerce, our shopping baskets are normally around 50 items. Customer experience is really important. If you have to click 50 times in the basket, you get tired quite fast. We do a lot of article relation models and use them to do cross-sell, upsell, and recommendations for our customers.

We also look at your purchase history, for instance, and serve you with your most favorite items and most purchased items. We try to predict what your next best action is going to be so we can also serve you with recommendations based on what we think. We also give you inspiration on what other customers who are similar to you are buying. That's another area, and I think I forgot about half of our AI models right now, but that's massive to have so many models trained. In order to train them, you need to have data, which is the one that provides value. Right now, we're talking a lot about unified data.

### Building a Unified Data Strategy: Balancing Innovation and Risk

We need to have a really clear framework on how we are using data and where we are placing data so we can take the best out of that. For me, this is vital for a company to really have a proper strategy on data. What's happening right now is that many application providers like SAP, Salesforce, and other companies are building solutions and applications that use big data. For SAP, for instance, they are extracting data from their core systems into SAP Business Data Cloud and then building new modules on top of it. If you want to buy a new replenishment model in a couple of years when it's finished, it's going to require you to have SAP Business Data Cloud probably.

At the same time, most customers have already started to build up their ecosystems in the cloud. We've done that on AWS, and many other customers have done it on some other cloud. We've chosen a different way already with our data stacks. Now you get the question: how are you going to marry these two worlds together when SAP comes with SAP Business Data Cloud and you've got something else? I think you need to have a good data strategy that answers questions like whether you are going to work in data silos, federate, or replicate all the data.

At Axfood, we've been replicating data from all systems, both SAP and non-SAP, for a very long time. For us, the answer is really simple: we need to replicate the data. You want to have a master. We need to have a master exactly. I mean, there could be use cases if that is interesting in the future, but I think you still need to have one master for all your data and that needs to be in open formats and open standards as well. You will get some lock-in whatever you choose, but I would definitely go for the thing that's most open in this case.

In order to have this differentiation that you're talking about, you're going to be more efficient than your competitors and provide a better user experience to your customers. You're using all these models that you have trained leveraging your data strategy with all the elements, SAP or non-SAP, that are able to generate this data. But there are some situations where decisions on how you are going to run your data strategy are more financial, maybe a capital expenditure thing, than really an innovation. What I'm hearing from you is basically innovation.

Imagine when these conversations have been taken by the CFO or someone that is able to see a bit broader and say, "What I want to run is this differentiation that is going to make my company still be valuable and strong after some years." I think what's going on right now is that most customers are migrating from SAP ECC to S/4HANA or to some cloud, and everybody's asking, "Can I introduce some innovation in that process?" I would say that depends on how much you use SAP. For us, it's really intertwined in our business. We've got it everywhere basically, so doing these projects is a big risk. It's really core processes. You don't touch them easily.

Most other customers I know tend to go for a one-to-one scope when they do the S/4HANA migration. After that, you can do innovation because having a clean, right-sized ERP running in the cloud is basically the basis for innovation in the future. Of course, if you're only doing a re-hosting project, you might need some use cases where you can do infrastructural innovation. That might be a case, but still, it depends on the risk you have in the project. Innovation is hard to combine with this. I think you get a good baseline and then innovate. That makes sense.

I think it goes with the idea that there's no single way to do things. You really need to understand what your projects are, what your objectives are, and what are the best projects that you can do here. What are the people that can help you minimize risks and optimize outcomes? That's the idea here. What about looking forward? What are the projects that are keeping you awake now or super excited? What are these things that are telling you these are going to be the next big things that we are going to do to continue disrupting the market?

### Looking Forward: Data Products, Agentic AI, and Key Lessons Learned

Well, data strategy is one important topic. I mean, it's never finished. I would say it's continuous work that you have. We are building data products. We've been using data professionally for over ten to fifteen years now. We build multiple layers of data. We've got a semantic layer as well.

When you introduce data products to that, you need to think through how you structure your layers in the data stack. We're working a lot with data products right now and also with the governance on them. That's one area where I see a lot of innovation. The world of agentic AI requires you to have good clean data and also support technical support for the use cases, so we're looking at MCP servers and looking at how to expose the data in a nice way to be able to have the next generation of agents running.

I'm dreaming of this system where you have the data and you can have sensory stuff in your data layers like this happened in my business, so I'm going to do that. We were discussing the idea that the work of the integration between systems eventually is going to disappear because the agents are going to be able to talk to each other and facilitate this. So the focus would be on really optimizing the interconnectivity within different elements.

If I had to give final advice for the audience, out of the lessons learned throughout all these years, these are the golden nuggets that I want to share with you. We introduced some high value use cases early on for us and that got the attention of our management. They started to measure the impact of AI on our business and really that was key for us to get funds released to get organizational maturity. In that way we could create teams with the right staffing and we could focus on collaboration between data scientists and more traditional IT staff.

Otherwise I would say it's a hard world for your suppliers right now. They have different agendas and you might have your agenda, and the timelines might not align. I would say try to find some common ground where you can build from. Besides that, use good technology. For us it's AWS. For somebody else it might be something different.

So basically try to prove the value of the things that you're doing as soon as possible and leverage the state of the art technology to be able to be more effective and competitive. Get management on board. Yes, exactly. So folks, if you really want to go a bit deeper on Gustav's story with Axford this afternoon, your session is MAM 2:14 if I'm not wrong. You're going to be on a stage with the slides and you're going to show a nice deck explaining all these things and many other projects that you're running.

I would really encourage you if you want to go deeper into all the things that Gustav has been able to do at his company to attend that session because it's the one that is going to really show you what's internally happening within Axford. So that was it, folks. Hope you enjoyed the session. Gustav, thanks a lot for being here with us today. It's been a pleasure and of course if you have doubts or questions we will be more than happy to talk to you once the session is over. Thank you so much. Hope you enjoyed that and have a lot of fun and learn a lot from re:Invent. Thank you so much for being here.
