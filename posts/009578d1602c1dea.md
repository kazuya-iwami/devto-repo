### Introduction: Navigating Enterprise Software Licensing and Optimization on AWS

 All right, hi everyone. Thank you so much for joining us today on this first morning of re:Invent 2025. Just if you wish, a show of hands for any of you who this is not your first session for today. Nice, I got some early starters, I like it. All right, so my name is Christine Megit, and I am a Microsoft Licensing Specialist here at AWS, and I'm joined today by my colleagues, GianPaolo and Valerie. And today, we're going to speak to you about enterprise software licensing and optimization on AWS.

There is going to be a focus on Microsoft licensing just because we do have some new features that we want to highlight today, so we're excited to share that with you. And before I begin, I'm just going to start with a bit of a quote. Most presentations like to start with an impactful or motivational quote. I'm not sure that's what we have here, but this is something that we do hear from customers on a regular basis at least once a week.

[![Thumbnail 60](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/60.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=60)

[![Thumbnail 70](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/70.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=70)

[![Thumbnail 80](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/80.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=80)

 So Microsoft licensing especially can be really difficult, and we're here today to kind of break down some of that complexity for you.  Microsoft licensing is complex. There are different agreement types, different license models, and the question of whether the product is eligible for License Mobility benefits.  Show of hands if anyone knows about License Mobility benefits. Good, all right, nice.

So today, we're going to speak to you about the Optimization and Licensing Assessment, and Val's going to kick that off. That's a fully funded program that we have for Enterprise workloads, not just Microsoft licensing. I'm going to take over again and I'm going to talk to you about bringing your own license, as well as some of our License Included offerings. And then I'll go into some licensing optimization best practices, including highlighting some new features that we are going to announce that will help you save some costs.

Then I'll hand it over to GianPaolo, and he's going to speak to you about Optimize CPU for License Included, which is one of the new features we want to highlight, and also provide a live demo for AWS Compute Optimizer and Optimize CPU. Then we'll kick it back over to Valerie who's going to discuss how to get started, how to start realizing these savings and these new features, especially through our OLA program. All right, I'm going to hand it over to you Valerie.

### The Optimization and Licensing Assessment (OLA) Program: A Data-Driven Approach to Cloud Migration

Thanks Christy, awesome. All right, so a question for the audience: how many of you have ever googled Microsoft licensing and immediately regretted it? Yes, all right, I see a lot of hands, that was surprising. Great audience engagement. All right, so how do you make informed decisions about migrating to the cloud without becoming an expert in optimization strategies or getting that PhD in Microsoft licensing that Christine mentioned?

Well, the good news is that we have a program built at AWS for this. So the Optimization and Licensing Assessment program, or OLA program that Christine mentioned, is purposely built to help you optimize both your compute and your licensing costs when you're considering a migration to AWS. My name's Valerie Rosenfield, I'm a part of the OLA program. I've been on this team for about five years, serving our customers as a Migration Assessment Specialist.

[![Thumbnail 210](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/210.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=210)

[![Thumbnail 220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=220)

So I help customers when they are considering migrating all workloads, but specifically for today, Microsoft workloads to the cloud, review what they have in their environment, understand what their key business priorities are, any open questions that they have, and then recommend an assessment process that will get them answers in the most efficient manner.  There we go, there's the OLA slide. Awesome, all right, so OLA is all about simplifying your migration and your licensing journey.  What are the benefits for customers? Actually I'll ask another question.

How many of you are customers who are already running on AWS today? Oh, nice, awesome, you will love this presentation then. How many customers are considering migrating to the cloud in one to two years, but don't run any workloads yet on AWS, anybody? Awesome, okay, any partners in the audience? Awesome, awesome. Okay, that's great context for talking about how OLA helps simplify the migration journey.

[![Thumbnail 250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=250)

[![Thumbnail 260](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/260.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=260)

[![Thumbnail 270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=270)

 It's good to know who we have here in the audience.  First off, OLA is a data-driven assessment that is built to answer three key questions when customers are considering migration or post-migration, which it sounds like is most relevant to the audience here today. The first is collecting an inventory. So we need to know what is in your environment and how is it being used.  That visibility is crucial because cloud optimization is all about running as lean as possible, as many of you will know, and we can't optimize what we can't see, so the OLA starts with that baseline inventory of understanding what you have in the environment.

[![Thumbnail 290](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/290.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=290)

Next, we assess the business case for the cloud or we assess how you can optimize your existing footprint that is already running in AWS.  So we will review your environment to understand if rehosting, replatforming, or refactoring is the right approach, show you costing options for each of those, and along the way, we'll show you how you can optimize both your compute and your licensing.

[![Thumbnail 310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=310)

[![Thumbnail 320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=320)

For customers who are considering a new migration to the cloud,  the OLA data also serves as the building blocks for helping you plan the journey. You're often working with a partner on the assessment, sometimes working with the AWS account team,  and this data helps them dive deeper to understand what your priorities are, what your timelines are around migration, and importantly, this program also helps qualify you for different AWS programs and incentives.

[![Thumbnail 340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=340)

[![Thumbnail 360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=360)

[![Thumbnail 370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=370)

What is the impact of OLA in numbers?  First, as Christine mentioned, the OLA comes at no cost to customers. This is an investment that AWS makes in setting customers up for success as they migrate and for those of you who are already running in AWS post-migration. Next, we see that customers who perform one of these exercises and take the recommendations  that are surfaced in the OLA achieve a 36% cost reduction. Finally, migrations are about 34% faster when you're executing the migration based on real data  instead of guesswork.

[![Thumbnail 400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=400)

[![Thumbnail 410](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/410.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=410)

### Microsoft Workload Assessment: Key Questions and Cost Reduction Strategies

Let me zoom in a little bit on the Microsoft side of the assessment.  When customers are considering a migration of their Microsoft workloads to AWS, they come to us with five key questions normally, and OLA has the answers for those. The first is, what does my Windows and SQL Server footprint look like? That goes back to collecting that baseline inventory as the first step.  We'll talk about what that looks like process-wise on the following slide.

[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=430)

[![Thumbnail 440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=440)

Next is, how can I reduce my SQL cores?  We see that the majority of customer spend on Microsoft products is typically on SQL Server, especially in terms of what gets migrated to the cloud. So that is the top of mind product when customers are thinking about cost optimization. Next, can I bring my own licenses to AWS, or BYOL?  Most of you will be familiar with that terminology. The good news is the answer is typically yes, though there are, of course, nuances, and that's exactly what the OLA will help you navigate.

[![Thumbnail 470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=470)

[![Thumbnail 500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/500.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=500)

Even if you can bring your Microsoft licenses to AWS, should you?  Today, we're going to be talking about an exciting feature that is released for License Included workloads that can help reduce that spend versus BYOL. In the future, we actually do think that License Included options will become more cost competitive for customers, so stay tuned for that. Finally, how do I optimize my Enterprise Agreement, my EA renewal with Microsoft as I migrate?  If you can execute one of these assessments shortly before your EA renewal, that's really the prime time to do it because then you can actually realize the savings that will surface to you in the OLA. As many of you will know, this is usually a three-year term, so if you can do this exercise in preparation for that, you'll avoid that lock-in or be able to choose more flexible options when you do renew with Microsoft.

[![Thumbnail 530](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/530.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=530)

Tying it back to that first question, how do we collect an inventory of your Windows and SQL Server footprint?  OLA can support you in two ways for this. If you have a tool on premise that already has an inventory of your environment with limited gaps and has your SQL inventory, you can supply that to us instead of installing a tool, which sometimes takes some time, and we'll clean it, consolidate it, and analyze it for you, turning it into an AWS business case.

[![Thumbnail 560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/560.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=560)

[![Thumbnail 580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=580)

If you don't have a tool on premise with high coverage or you just want to get a fresh dataset, AWS, as part of the investment that we make in the OLA program, will fund a discovery tool for you to collect the information.  There are a few tools that we use for this process. You may be familiar with some of these names. This isn't the full tool set, but it's what we use on the majority of engagements. We have our first-party AWS Migration Evaluator tool and two third-parties named Cloudamize and modelizeIT. In terms of the information that we get from Microsoft workloads, you're going to get the editions and the versions of your Windows and SQL Server deployments.  We'll get information on how those are utilized, so the CPU, memory, and storage utilization, and then the instances and databases that are running. The purpose of this is to inform the Windows and SQL Server optimization analysis that we'll walk you through on the following slide.

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=600)

Let's get to the good stuff. This is a sample OLA output from a recent customer engagement, and this was an existing customer in AWS. I think it will resonate with the audience that we have here today.  This customer was a large healthcare customer with $16.5 million of EC2 spend.

[![Thumbnail 630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=630)

[![Thumbnail 650](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/650.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=650)

The first optimization that we are going to surface in an OLA is right-sizing your workloads. This is the basic level one version of optimization where you are just running the most cost effective instance that meets your performance needs. AWS has a variety of different instance families, and so a lot of times, you're running one that doesn't perfectly suit whether that workload is compute, memory, or storage intensive.  Just switching the family can reduce your costs. In this case, right-sizing their Linux EC2 workloads saved them about 12%. This is a savings opportunity, so perhaps they execute on 50% of those, but still pretty meaningful savings at $1 million. 

[![Thumbnail 710](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/710.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=710)

The next optimizations are specific to Windows EC2 and SQL EC2 workloads, and this is what we're going to dive deeper into with Christine and GP later in the presentation, so I won't go into too much detail. But an exciting new feature allows you to tailor the number of vCPUs that you have on your Windows and SQL License Included instances. As many of you will know, those licensing models are core based, so anytime you're reducing the core counts, you're going to reduce your licensing costs, and this actually comes directly off of your AWS bill. So if you're purchasing Windows or SQL licensing from AWS, which most of you will be, this will reflect a reduction on your AWS spend. In this case, it was a 13% additional savings, so another $2 million that before this launch wasn't even possible. This is an incremental strategy that is really going to make some important savings changes for our customers. 

[![Thumbnail 760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=760)

Finally, the standard output that you're going to get for SQL is an additional optimization strategy: identifying SQL workloads that look like they're non-prod. Microsoft has a free edition of SQL Server called Developer edition, and so during the OLA, we'll flag instances that look like they are non-prod based on their naming convention, such as dev, test, QA, and so on. We'll summarize the cores that are running on those and show you what you're likely spending on your Microsoft contracts for those non-prod cores, so you can make an informed decision about whether you should downgrade to that free edition of Microsoft SQL Server called Developer edition. In this case, it was an incremental 2% savings, so a little bit lighter than the other savings, but sometimes this is the easiest one for customers to execute, so it's still pretty helpful. 

[![Thumbnail 780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=780)

Cumulatively, this was a $5 million savings opportunity for the customer, and they were very pleased because for them, even if they only achieved 25% of these savings, it would still be over $1 million, which meant a meaningful cost reduction and a reinvestment opportunity for them. 

[![Thumbnail 820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=820)

### Optimizing Microsoft Enterprise Agreement Renewals Through OLA Insights

The final question that we usually address in an OLA is how do I optimize my Microsoft Enterprise Agreement renewal? We highly encourage doing one of these exercises six months to one year in advance of your EA renewal, so you can go into that conversation with the insights from the OLA, especially if you're seriously considering a cloud migration within the next year as well. Is anybody coming up on their Microsoft EA renewal in the next year? We don't know. Not procurement people, it sounds like. 

[![Thumbnail 850](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/850.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=850)

Well, there are some standard insights that will surface as a part of this process, and then we have experts who can dive deeper and look at your unique contracts if you are interested in that type of tailored analysis. The first one is that for Windows Server, most customers are going to migrate to shared tenancy in AWS, and that comes with the Windows License Included. Our standard recommendation is to avoid double payment. You should discontinue the payments that you make to Microsoft annually for Windows Software Assurance to reduce your net costs. 

[![Thumbnail 890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=890)

For SQL Server, we encourage customers to switch from perpetual licensing to subscription in certain scenarios. This is not right for every customer, but if you know that you will be optimizing your cores further after migration but you don't have time to do it before your EA renewal, a good option can be to switch to subscription licensing so you have the flexibility to true-down sooner. EA is a three-year lock-in unless you do that subscription licensing, which would give you more flexibility to true-down after a year. So it's something to consider if you know you're going to optimize but you can't do it immediately. 

Next, and again, this is going to tie to GP's and Christine's presentation on Optimize CPU for License Included workloads, but evaluating whether License Included is a better option for you than Bring-Your-Own-License.

[![Thumbnail 920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=920)

Outside of it becoming more cost competitive, License Included offers more cost competitiveness with this new feature. Beyond that, many customers prefer not to manage licensing with Microsoft, which makes sense. You can outsource that to AWS, and we manage the licensing payments to Microsoft. 

Finally, there is the option of downgrades, which we discussed briefly. This is more associated with your production workloads. If you have production workloads running Enterprise edition software, you often are not using the Enterprise features. In those cases, it is actually less expensive to buy new perpetual Standard licenses than to renew the annual maintenance payments on Enterprise Edition. Enterprise is about four times more expensive than Standard, so that is another thing you can consider. Assess whether you are actually using the features, and if not, it might be a good opportunity to make the change and downgrade to Standard edition.

[![Thumbnail 970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=970)

These are the standard recommendations  that you will get in an OLA output. Behind every OLA, we have a team of licensing experts like myself, GP, and Christine, who you can tap into if you have more custom or specific asks. They can also answer follow-up questions on the licensing insights that we present. Christine is the expert in Microsoft licensing and our go-to resource, so I will pass it over to her to give more detailed insights on how to optimize and manage in the cloud.

### Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL): Understanding License Mobility and SQL Server Licensing Models

Thank you so much, Valerie. Now I am going to go over some licensing information for you. I will start with Bring-Your-Own-License and how that works on AWS. I mentioned earlier that it looks like many of you  are already familiar with License Mobility benefits, but if you are not familiar, this is a Software Assurance benefit that allows you to bring your eligible products to a shared tenancy environment such as EC2 on AWS. 

[![Thumbnail 1030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1030)

[![Thumbnail 1040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1040)

[![Thumbnail 1050](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1050.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1050)

To qualify, the product itself must be eligible for License Mobility benefits. It is not necessarily enough that there is Software Assurance; the product also must be eligible.  Again, Software Assurance and eligible subscriptions are required, and this can be deployed on shared or dedicated tenancy.  There is also a License Mobility Verification Form that you need to fill out up to 10 days after deployment.

For some products that are eligible for License Mobility benefits,  we have Azure DevOps, Exchange Server, Project Server, SharePoint Server, SQL Server, System Center Server, and some others as well.  Let me dive in a bit more into SQL Server BYOL, as it is a very popular product for customers to bring. 

[![Thumbnail 1090](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1090.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1090)

If we are looking at the core model, one core license covers one vCPU on shared tenant EC2. There is a four core licensing minimum set by Microsoft.  You could potentially deploy on an instance smaller than four vCPUs, but you would still need to assign four cores of licensing as a minimum. Again, Software Assurance is required. Looking at this chart of the r7a instance family, you will see the r7a.large has two vCPUs, but you would assign four cores because of that four core licensing minimum. If you were to deploy on the r7a.24xlarge instance, you would bring 96 cores of SQL.

[![Thumbnail 1140](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1140.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1140)

For the server CAL model, we do not come across this as often, but it is definitely something that some customers still have for specific use cases.  Here you will have one server license per EC2 instance or per VM, plus you will have the additional user or Device CALs for all users or devices that have access, whether that is direct or indirect access. You will also need Software Assurance or eligible subscriptions on the server licenses and also the CALs. Again, just a reminder that the License Mobility Verification Form is required.

[![Thumbnail 1160](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1160.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1160)

[![Thumbnail 1180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1180)

A bit more on BYOL for SQL Server: there is a passive failover benefit available for customers that are bringing their licenses with their Software Assurance.  Again, this is a Software Assurance benefit and it is one-to-one, so it works differently than what you might be able to do on-premises. That is a key note to consider. One SQL Server EC2 instance, for example, allows you to deploy a secondary passive SQL Server instance of the same size or smaller in terms of vCPUs.  This is not eligible for active-active configurations.

[![Thumbnail 1190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1190)

[![Thumbnail 1200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1200.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1200)

Looking at this example here with two R5 instances with eight vCPUs each, the passive instance does not need to be licensed for SQL, but the active instance would be licensed for SQL.  Overall, eight cores of SQL Server licensing are required for this configuration. For non-production, as Valerie touched on earlier,  SQL Server Developer edition is free for you to bring for non-production workloads, so it is a BYOL scenario.

[![Thumbnail 1240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1240.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1240)

[![Thumbnail 1250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1250)

With the release of SQL Server 2025, there are now two Developer editions available for that version. One covers Enterprise edition features, and one covers Standard edition features, which is great for those of you that are only looking to deploy Standard edition in production. Once you move to production, you can use that Standard edition Developer edition. For anyone deploying SQL Server 2022 or earlier versions, you would still use the Standard Developer edition that covers all features up to Enterprise edition.   

As a reminder, to use this Developer edition, you cannot be connected to a production database, and it cannot be used for disaster recovery. It does include all the same features as Enterprise edition, except of course where you are using the new 2025 version that does have a Standard edition. As with any BYOL on AWS, you are required to bring your own media or install for the products that you are bringing.

[![Thumbnail 1270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1270)

### Windows Server BYOL: Navigating the October 2019 Policy Changes

Now I am going to shift gears to bringing products that do not have License Mobility benefits.  There were some changes that were made effective October 1st, 2019. These changes specifically impacted products that are not eligible for License Mobility benefits, so this does not impact anything I have just spoken about previously. To bring a product that is not eligible for License Mobility benefits, such as Windows Server, the version you are deploying first must be a version that was released before October 1st, 2019. For Windows Server, that is version 2019 or earlier only.

You must also have perpetual licenses, not subscription licenses. The licenses must have been originally purchased before October 1st, 2019, or originally purchased within an Enterprise Agreement term that started before October 1st, 2019. This impacted products only not eligible for License Mobility benefits, which would be Windows Server, Visual Studio, and Office applications. SQL Server without Software Assurance would also not have License Mobility benefits, so that would also be impacted if you did not have Software Assurance on your SQL Server.

[![Thumbnail 1340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1340)

Just to dive a bit more into Windows Server BYOL, as it does come up quite often.  If you have those eligible licenses and you are deploying version 2019 or earlier, you would use dedicated hosts and you would license the total number of physical cores of the hosts. So if you are looking at an R5 EC2 dedicated host, for example, that has 48 physical cores, you would license 48 cores of Windows Server Datacenter, and you would be covered for any number of R5 instances that you can fit on that host. This is also true for our recently launched service, Amazon Elastic VMware Service. It is running on dedicated infrastructure, so it does allow you to bring your Windows Server licenses as well.

Software Assurance is not required for bringing Windows Server because it does not have License Mobility benefits. So whether you are using BYOL or you are moving to a License Included model, as Valerie mentioned, that is a great way to reduce costs at your next renewal by lowering that Software Assurance, as you will not be needing it.

[![Thumbnail 1420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1420)

[![Thumbnail 1430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1430)

### License Included Offerings: Windows Server and SQL Server on AWS

For License Included and some of the offerings we have there, Windows Server License Included is most commonly used by customers because it does allow customers to deploy on shared EC2.  It covers any edition. We do not always list an edition, but our licensing agreement with Microsoft is very specific and customized, and it covers any edition.  It also includes unlimited Windows Server Client Access Licenses, as well as two Remote Desktop Services connections for each EC2 instance that is using License Included.

[![Thumbnail 1440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1440)

[![Thumbnail 1450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1450.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1450)

This is a required licensing option on shared EC2.  It is also required for versions 2022 and 2025 of Windows Server, and that is because those versions were released after the October 1st, 2019 changes.  Windows Server License Included is billed per vCPU per second for on-demand instances. It is an option that can be used for external use. So for example, if you are an Independent Software Vendor or a Software-as-a-Service provider that was impacted by the SPLA BYOL changes where Microsoft no longer allows SPLA BYOL on AWS, License Included is a compatible option for those workloads.

[![Thumbnail 1470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1470)

[![Thumbnail 1490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1490)

If you need additional Remote Desktop Services connections,  we do offer those as License Included. But you can also bring your own Remote Desktop Services User Client Access Licenses with Software Assurance through License Mobility benefits. For License Included SQL Server,  we offer this in the core model only, so there are no Client Access Licenses required. We offer this in Standard, Enterprise, and Web edition. Again, with the release of SQL Server 2025, there is no new Web edition available. So 2022 Web edition is the last edition available, and it is a very specific use case. Web edition can only be used for publicly accessible websites.

[![Thumbnail 1510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1510)

[![Thumbnail 1520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1520)

[![Thumbnail 1530](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1530.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1530)

If you're not familiar with that edition, that probably means you can't use it.  However, it is something that we do offer through 2022. This is also billed per vCPU per second for on-demand instances, and it can also be used for external use.  So if you're an ISV or a SaaS provider, this option also replaces the SPLA BYOL that was removed.

### New Licensing Optimization Features: High Availability for SQL Server and Optimize CPU for License Included

Now let's move on to some licensing optimization recommendations and best practices. We have a free tool called AWS License Manager, which is a great tool to use to input your licenses that you're bringing. It can also be used to review your License Included instances, which is a great way to keep track of what you're using. You can use it to integrate with dedicated hosts and other services. I highly recommend checking this out if you haven't already. It can be used with a variety of different software. It doesn't have to be Microsoft; there are many different vendors that it supports, and you can use it even for on-premises workloads and other clouds as well. 

[![Thumbnail 1580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1580)

This is a view of what it looks like when you're inputting some licenses. You can choose whether you want to enforce a license limit or not enforce it, where you just get a warning message if you go over your licensing.  If you are interested in learning more about this tool, I'm also speaking at a second session on Thursday called MAM321: Licensing Management and Optimization, where we will discuss some new licensing features through License Manager. That session is on Thursday, December 4th at the MGM Grand. This QR code will take you to the catalog where you can see the location.

Instance right-sizing is a core component of our OLA offerings. This can benefit License Included. Our products are licensed per vCPU for Windows Server and SQL Server, so the more your instance is right-sized, the more your licensing costs will be optimized as well.  For BYOL, this is also beneficial because SQL licensing for BYOL is licensed per vCPU if you're bringing core licenses.  Right-sizing will optimize your licensing that you're bringing over as well. On the Windows Server side, this can help in both ways. With BYOL, if you're right-sizing, you can end up with fewer hosts,  which means lower infrastructure costs and lower licensing costs as well. OLA will help you figure all of this out.

For a new feature that we recently launched, Amazon EC2 High Availability for SQL Server is now available  for License Included SQL Server. This feature allows you to not license the passive or secondary node. Previously, this was required; you had to license both if you were using License Included. Now, if you're using License Included, you will be exempt from the SQL License Included costs on that secondary passive node.  This supports two EC2 instances per SQL Server High Availability cluster. It supports Always On Availability Groups as well as failover cluster instances.  You only pay for the Windows Server License Included costs on the passive nodes, as well as the compute costs. The passive SQL Server instance needs to be the same size  or smaller than the active SQL Server instance. This is available for new and existing instances. You can go into the console to update your instances if you have these already  or you can use this for new deployments. It does require AWS Systems Manager Agent to be installed and running on the instances for this to work.  If you want to learn more, we have this QR code here as well. We have lots of documentation for you, including a blog that has been released, so check that out.

[![Thumbnail 1760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1760)

For another new feature that has been recently launched, and this will be discussed extensively in our session, Optimize CPU for License Included is now available.  Previously, customers could use Optimize CPU to lower their number of vCPUs on an instance, which would let them bring fewer SQL Core licenses.  This now is available for License Included as well. It not only impacts SQL Server License Included but also impacts Windows Server License Included. This is a great way for customers who for the most part have to use Windows Server License Included on shared EC2 if there's room for optimization there. By disabling hyper-threading or using a specific number of vCPUs, this will immediately lower your License Included costs  for Windows Server as well as SQL Server. Using this feature, you will see separate billing for licensing, so it will be broken out of your EC2 instance costs, which is new. Typically, without using this feature, your License Included costs will be within your compute costs. This feature will separate those.

[![Thumbnail 1810](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1810.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1810)

This is available for new and existing instances.  Here's an example of the x1e family type. You can see the max vCPUs is the default vCPUs the instance size comes with. You can turn these down all the way to the examples shown here. Just remember, SQL Server licensing has a four core minimum even for License Included, so we wouldn't necessarily recommend going all the way down. However, if you were to go below four cores, you'd still see license costs for four cores.

### Optimize CPU Deep Dive: Reducing SQL Server Licensing Costs Through vCPU Configuration

That's it for me. I'm going to hand it over to GianPaolo. Thank you. My name is GianPaolo Albanese, and I'm a Solutions Architect Specialist. I've been at AWS for eight years. The one thing I got from the session so far is that I have real trouble sleeping at night. If you want to fall asleep very quickly, you can read about the licensing that Microsoft provides. I would appreciate Amazon Polly to read it to me very slowly and softly so you fall asleep right away, or you can go to a bar. But this probably works best.

[![Thumbnail 1880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1880)

[![Thumbnail 1890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1890)

Let's talk about Optimize CPU and SQL Server.  Why is this important? SQL Server licensing is based on active CPUs  that are visible to the operating system. What we're seeing more and more is that customers need to deploy larger EC2 instance sizes because they have specific requirements, either IOPS requirements or memory requirements. If you want 512 gigabytes of RAM allocated to your instance, you might have to deploy an r6idn.16xlarge. That's a lot of money. There's significant cost involved. Every time you spin up one of these machines just to accommodate one of your workloads, there's a huge cost that happens on licensing.

[![Thumbnail 1940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1940)

[![Thumbnail 1950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/1950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=1950)

What we're trying to do is minimize that cost. What can we do?  As Valerie and Christine mentioned, we have a new feature called Optimize CPU.  Optimize CPU allows you to modify the instance type after launch. After you start analyzing your workload and figuring out exactly what works or what the perfect balance is between CPU, memory, and storage, you can stop the instance and start making modifications. One thing you can do is disable hyper-threading on the CPU after you accept the default instance you've deployed. This allows you to modify the CPU configuration after you stop the instance.

We notice that most of the time when you're dealing with high performance compute workloads or scientific calculations, disabling hyper-threading actually helps a lot. You see an improvement because there's no context switching with the operating system. At this point, you can also go even further. After you disable hyper-threading and start analyzing your workload, you can go back and trim down the CPUs. Maybe you don't have to dedicate four CPUs for your Windows Server. Maybe you can go for two if you're not running SQL Server. Remember, SQL Server requires four CPUs. There's no way around that. That's another way you can reduce cost.

[![Thumbnail 2040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2040)

 What are some of the key benefits that our customers are seeing? First, you start seeing a reduction in your SQL Server cost, especially with Bring-Your-Own-License into AWS. There's a new feature coming up where this will be available also for License Included on SQL Server. I also know that there's a lot of commercial software with specific requirements about how many CPUs you need to run to be compliant. Especially if you have third-party support and need to open a case, you want to make sure you follow the guidelines from the third-party vendor or the CAL application requirements.

[![Thumbnail 2080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2080)

 Something else you can see is that some customers are seeing real performance improvements when they disable hyper-threading on some workloads. You need to test that out. We have CloudWatch and CloudMetrics that you can use to collect information, or if you have your own collection agents, you can start collecting this information and analyze it.

[![Thumbnail 2120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2120)

[![Thumbnail 2150](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2150.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2150)

We have another exciting tool that we can use to help you figure out exactly what is working for your particular workload. We're seeing some customers now improving and having performance improvement just by disabling hyper-threading.  Another benefit is lower infrastructure cost, and that's key because AWS is a differentiator with other cloud providers. We always try to help customers save costs by providing you the tools to analyze your workload. You can then work with any one of us—a solutions architect or specialist—to help you figure out where we can trim things or lower the cost a little bit  so that you can save some money.

[![Thumbnail 2170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2170)

[![Thumbnail 2190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2190)

[![Thumbnail 2200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2200.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2200)

What are some of the best practices specifically when you're dealing with SQL CPU optimization? There are some things that you really need to be careful about and watch out for. First, once you disable hyper-threading  on SQL Server specifically, we don't see any major impact on performance on the machine. In fact, that's a quick win for saving money. The beauty of this is that, especially if you're dealing with online transactional processing, it actually benefits the operating system  and the server runs much better and performs better. With the first step, you see almost 35% cost savings. 

If you go to the next steps and start looking and monitoring your environment even more, you start realizing that maybe you can throttle down even the core count. If you do this, you can actually achieve 47% cost savings without impacting your workload. However, I want to be extremely careful here. You have to continuously test the environment and collect metrics to make sure that you're actually achieving those goals. Sometimes what's happening is you might have certain processes or certain systems that at the end of the month are very transactional and running some big batch jobs. You want to minimize any impact on your performance.

The other thing I want to mention is that you need to monitor the IOPS and CPU ratio.  We found that 7,000 to 8,000 IOPS per CPU is the sweet spot where you can get good performance and also achieve cost savings. If you start deviating from this IOPS requirement per CPU, if you go too high, you have system contention. What happens is the IOPS are very high and the subsystem is working very hard, so the storage IOPS system is actually being impacted. If you go the other way and lower the IOPS, you're seeing that your CPU is actually idling and not doing anything—it's waiting for the system to provide data.

Testing is key, and you want to monitor the IOPS for your environment. Lastly, test, test, test. You have to test your workload,  test with load, with no load, test over the weekend nights, test during Black Friday—just test it. We have a lot of tools that we can provide you. We have CloudWatch metrics that can help you monitor all these things. You can also set alerts or create an SNS topic and send the information  to your email or to a dashboard.

Now, let me show you how to do this in the demo. Let me switch over to my screen, and if everything works well, there you go.  You have your Console here.  I have a bunch of instances running on my system.  Let's say that I have this SQL Server  that I'm running on m5.xlarge. If you look at the instance, if you don't know anything about m5.xlarge, you can actually see how many CPUs  are allocated to the system. 

[![Thumbnail 2410](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2410.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2410)

[![Thumbnail 2560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2560.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2560)

 Looking at the details on the bottom of the screen, you can see  information about the server itself. Right now, as you can see on the screen, eight CPUs are allocated to this virtual machine by default. When I deployed SQL Server Enterprise, I automatically enabled eight CPUs on it. However, if you want to adjust or experiment with hyper-threading, the first thing you need to do is stop the instance.  Once the instance is stopped, it will take a couple of minutes or so.  After that, you can go in and adjust the hyper-threading settings. When you do that and start the instance up again, it will allocate only the number of vCPUs that you have configured for that particular system. Let me refresh this real quick.  There we go. You go to Actions, then Instance Settings, and now you have a new option here that says Change CPUs.  This allows you to adjust the settings, and it gives you a note explaining that you can lower your Windows with SQL Server Standard vCPU licenses by adjusting these numbers. What I'm going to do is disable hyper-threading. Right now, we have two threads allocated per CPU across the server.  Notice what happens. First, you get a message about billing. If you're familiar with how EC2 is charged, usually with License Included, you see one cost. However, once you start adjusting the threading or CPU cores you enable and disable, it splits the cost. You'll see two prices: one for the instance and one for the number of CPUs actually allocated. I'm going to change it now. The only thing you need to do after this is start the instance.  Give it a minute.  Now you can see that the number of vCPUs is four. Going forward, if you have License Included with SQL Server running on it, you'll only pay for four licenses instead of eight. You can do this on every single server across your fleet and you'll start seeing cost savings. However, you might ask yourself, "Am I going to go through 5,000 servers and start clicking on things trying to figure out what works and what doesn't?" Obviously, you don't want to do that.

### AWS Compute Optimizer: Machine Learning-Powered Cost Optimization and Performance Analysis

So we have another tool, and I'm going to switch back to PowerPoint.  It's the AWS Compute Optimizer. This is a great tool because it takes the thought process of figuring out what works and what doesn't work in your environment to the next level. What is it? It's powered by Machine Learning. You hear about AI across the board, and this is a tool that I really love to use because it saves me a lot of time when I start analyzing my environment.  It is powered by Machine Learning and analyzes historical data collected from your systems, including CPU, memory, and IOPS consumption. It tracks all this data internally and identifies patterns that you may have missed. You run this in your environment by enabling a flag, and it starts analyzing your environment for you. Then it makes predictions, telling you something like, "I see cost savings of X thousands of dollars a month if you make these modifications." In the past, we had similar tools, but they only provided data. You could use Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and other tools, and you had to combine them together to get that data and figure out what to do with it. As it goes through, it starts looking at your EC2 instances, auto scaling groups, EBS volumes, storage, and Lambda functions. We also have Aurora and RDS databases being monitored, and we have ECS on Fargate as well.

[![Thumbnail 2720](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2720)

AWS Compute Optimizer is monitoring these services as well, and we will have more and more services being monitored by Compute Optimizer. What happens is that because it's using AI to do all of this, it's completely automated. Think about this:  You have a system working 24/7, monitoring your environment and collecting data constantly. Then it uses that data, runs algorithms against it, and figures out what will work best for you. This is predictive cost optimization, so you really don't have to do anything—you just have to turn on a flag.

[![Thumbnail 2760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2760)

The system also looks at your performance on the subsystem. If you remember before, we had to find a sweet spot of 7,000 to 8,000 IOPS per CPU, but we don't have to do that anymore. The system will do that for you, and it will make data-driven recommendations, which is very cool.  I have a quick dashboard here, and then I'm going to jump into my laptop to show you my environment because I had to collect some data first. For example, it gives you $185 a month in cost savings. You click on the EC2 instance, and you can see on the left side all these other services that it's actually monitoring for you. As I mentioned before, more and more services are going to be added.

[![Thumbnail 2790](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2790.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2790)

[![Thumbnail 2820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2820)

What it does is make a recommendation for you by looking at all your environment.  It looks at your workload and then tells you which systems are actually optimized and which ones are over-provisioned. It tells you what is over-provisioned and why. In this case, CPU is over-provisioned, EBS IOPS is over-provisioned, and so on, because I haven't done anything with these machines—they're basically sitting with IOPS running something. But if you look on the right pane, it gives you an estimated monthly cost of what the cost savings are. 

[![Thumbnail 2830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2830)

[![Thumbnail 2860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2860)

[![Thumbnail 2870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2870)

If we go back to my screen,  and we look at AWS Compute Optimizer, we can see how my account looks. It's definitely over-provisioned. I can actually save $1,000 a month. AWS saves $1,000 because I'm not paying for this. But look at these numbers—15% cost savings.  What I really like about this is that I can click on my EC2 instances, and now I have the data that I need.  It tells me that my SQL Server Optimize CPU instance is optimized, but there are a bunch of other instances that are not optimized.

[![Thumbnail 2880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2880)

The cool thing about this is that it's going to start making  recommendations for what the current instance type is and what the recommended instance size should be. Another thing you can also do is use this data to instead of changing instance sizes, because now we have Optimize CPU that we can leverage, go back and stop playing around with hyper-threading and turning off CPUs on your system. You don't necessarily have to do that, but you can use this as a guide to help you through it. This is very cool stuff. So the question you might have now is how to get started with all of this. I'm going to give it back to Valerie to continue.

[![Thumbnail 2940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2940)

### Getting Started: Leveraging OLA, AWS Transform, and New Features for Immediate Savings

We've just seen the power of Optimize CPU for License Included in real life. We saw some good usage of the AWS Compute Optimizer tool to right-size your workloads in other ways.  You may be wondering how you can start assessing the savings that are possible in your environment. As I mentioned, we do have these self-service tools in the AWS Console. Compute Optimizer is a great starting point if you like to get in the data and do it yourself. But the OLA program is here to support you as well, wherever that would be useful for you.

[![Thumbnail 2990](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/2990.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=2990)

Compute Optimizer does have the resource utilization data. You'll see your CPU, memory, IOPS, and throughput usage there. However, since the Optimize CPU for License Included feature was just released, it doesn't yet have recommendations on whether you should disable hyper-threading or whether you should just reduce the vCPUs instead of changing the instance type. That's where OLA can step in in the interim while those features are being rolled out to AWS Compute Optimizer.  For existing AWS workloads, this program is programmatically available for any customers carrying AWS Enterprise Support.

[![Thumbnail 3030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3030)

When customers have Enterprise Support, we have permissions to the necessary data to do the Optimization and Licensing Assessment (OLA) savings analysis. This is actually a very quick exercise for us. For those already running in AWS and carrying Enterprise Support, we can turn around the OLA insights in less than a week, and it requires almost no lift from you. The only thing that would require lift is really tagging your SQL Bring-Your-Own-License workloads if you are using any of those. 

[![Thumbnail 3070](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3070.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3070)

In order to launch this assessment, most of our sellers will be familiar with the OLA program. AWS is a large company, so your specific account manager might not know about the program. Ask your AWS account manager or your services partner if you're working through a partner about launching an OLA, or you can use the QR code provided. This will pop up an email that asks some questions about your environment and sends those responses directly to our team so we can get you started on your OLA for your existing EC2 environment. 

[![Thumbnail 3100](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3100.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3100)

For your non-AWS workloads, the program is also available for all customers. Since the savings we've reviewed today are so Microsoft-focused, the biggest impact occurs when you have around 100 Windows Servers or 10 licensable SQL Servers in your environment. However, we have the offering for all customers. Reach out to your AWS account manager and mention you learned about OLA at re:Invent, and they should know how to launch one. If not, you can contact us through the direct QR code as well. 

[![Thumbnail 3140](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3140.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3140)

We've talked a lot about Optimize CPU for License Included today. The census feature was just recently released, and we've only started to analyze customer environments. I have some savings from the last month of assessments that we've done that I'll show you. In the meantime, we have blog posts and user guides that we encourage you to check out. The documentation is very thorough, and there are many self-service tools that can help you get started immediately. 

[![Thumbnail 3160](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3160.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3160)

These are just a handful of results, and these savings are pretty preliminary since we just released the feature. However, I tried to provide a range of customer sizes and sample savings. We have a customer with $2 million in EC2 spend who had projected savings of 15% on their EC2 compute just from the Optimize CPU for License Included features. 

[![Thumbnail 3180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3180)

[![Thumbnail 3190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3190)

This is incremental to right-sizing and incremental to other SQL reduction opportunities we discussed, like non-production and development downgrades. So 15% of savings that weren't achievable before are now possible. We also see even more impressive savings for a medium-sized customer with 30% savings, 10% savings for another customer, and 24% savings for an extra-large customer.  

[![Thumbnail 3210](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3210.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3210)

On average, what we're seeing right now is around 20% savings. It's not a huge dataset, but that's about where we expect the savings to land on average—20% on your overall EC2 compute just from this one strategy. 

[![Thumbnail 3270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3270)

We've talked a lot about OLA today. Currently, OLA is a guided program. We have self-service tools like the one mentioned earlier, such as AWS Compute Optimizer. The OLA program is guided, so you engage with AWS. Either I work with you directly or sometimes you'll work with a certified OLA partner. We'll help you run the data collection, do the analysis, and read out the insights to you. However, in an ideal world, this would all be automated, and that is what we're moving towards with our tool called AWS Transform. 

AWS Transform is available to you in the AWS Console. Over time, the OLA insights that we've reviewed today are going to roll into AWS Transform. It's not quite at parity yet, but we encourage you to be an early adopter. Check out the tool and see what types of migration recommendations and licensing insights you can already get from it today. Provide us feedback and let us know what you think about it so we can continue enhancing it.

[![Thumbnail 3300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3300)

Today's session was heavily focused on Microsoft workloads, and that was on purpose. However, we do want to do a quick plug that for all major workload types, we have an assessment offering under the OLA program. We have modules for end user computing, storage, VMware, and Oracle. Let us know what your mix of workloads are, or tell your account manager or services partner, and we'll make sure we customize the assessment to what you have. Again, we have the QR code if you would like to reach out directly to the OLA team. 

[![Thumbnail 3310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3310)

We are just about ready to wrap up. I have the various QR codes on the next two slides  that we reviewed throughout the deck. So our Optimize CPU for License Included blog, requesting an OLA, and learning more about AWS Transform assessments. Give you a minute for those. On the next slide, we have a link to our Skill Builder AWS platform. This is a training platform with trainings on every AWS topic that you could imagine. There are over 1,000 deep dives, so whatever topic you are interested in, we encourage you to check out our Skill Builder platform to continue your Amazon AWS learning journey.

[![Thumbnail 3350](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/009578d1602c1dea/3350.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HSY9Cc3U1w&t=3350)

This will link you directly to the Microsoft workload section  of that Skill Builder page, but again, lots of trainings are available to you there. So I'll wrap us up with a couple of key takeaways. We have talked about three main things in this presentation. First, Microsoft licensing is complex, but we have the Optimization and Licensing Assessment (OLA) program available to you to provide clarity on the best way to migrate your Microsoft workloads to the cloud.

Second, we have our very new and exciting Optimize CPU for License Included features. We are really excited to see how this can make License Included offerings more cost advantageous for customers and really reduce the license compliance management that they have when they contract directly with Microsoft. Finally, AWS Transform is the future. We want to make this as accessible as possible for our customers, so we will continue to iterate and bring these optimization insights into AWS Transform, and we encourage you to check that out.

Thank you very much for joining us and spending the whole hour with us. We look forward to partnering with you on your migration journey or optimizing your existing AWS environments. We will be around if you have any questions. If you do not mind filling out the survey in the mobile app, we would really appreciate it. Enjoy re:Invent.
