### Understanding Quantum Computing: Not Just a Faster Classical Computer

 Thank you all for coming to Quantum Computing with Amazon Braket: From Exploration to Enterprise. My name is Eric Kessler. I'm the general manager of Amazon Braket, our quantum computing service by AWS. I'm very excited to be joined today by Michael Brett, who is the head of go-to-market for quantum computing at AWS. We're going to give you an overview of what we have been working on at AWS, how we see the industry evolve, and what you can do today already with this technology.

To give you an overview of what to expect today, I'm going to provide an introduction to what quantum computing is and where we are today. Then we're going to go into an overview of what we're doing at AWS before we dive into hybrid quantum-classical workloads and how we're supporting these cutting-edge workloads at AWS. Finally, we're going to look at one particular customer case study about drug design with AstraZeneca, and we're going to show you how you can get started with quantum computing.

[![Thumbnail 40](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/40.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=40)

 I wanted to address a very common misconception about quantum computing right from the start. A quantum computer is not a classical computer that just runs a little bit faster. In fact, quantum computers are actually very slow compared to the clock cycles of classical computers. Instead, a quantum computer can run a richer class of algorithms compared to classical computers. You may ask why we need a richer class of algorithms when we have classical algorithms that work just fine. Well, it turns out there are certain types of applications where all the algorithms that we know require exponential overhead as the problem gets bigger. The time needed, the memory needed, and other resources needed all grow exponentially.

[![Thumbnail 70](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/70.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=70)

 One of the prototypical problems of that kind is simulating quantum systems themselves. This is the home turf application of quantum computers. When we look at a system with particles like electrons that interact with each other and behave quantum mechanically, simulating them with a classical computer becomes extremely challenging. Already 50 of those particles require supercomputing-scale classical computing. Because the scaling is exponential, if we go from 50 to 100 particles, it becomes completely out of reach for any computer today and in the future. This idea is almost the founding idea of quantum computing and goes back a long time now.

[![Thumbnail 110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=110)

 This concept goes back to 1981 with Richard Feynman's very famous quote where he said, "Nature isn't classical, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, then you better make it quantum mechanical. And by golly, it's a wonderful problem because it doesn't look so easy." It's actually a very hard problem to build a quantum computer. The technology is still early, but we're seeing a lot of improvements.

[![Thumbnail 170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=170)

 The take-home message is that quantum computers can solve some problems with exponentially fewer gates or fewer operations than classical computers because they use different types of algorithms. To put it provocatively, it's not a two times speed-up, but a two to the power of X speed-up. Because it's exponential, that's the difference between something that's possible and something that's not possible to compute.

[![Thumbnail 190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=190)

 From this brief introduction, there are actually some very profound learnings and lessons we can take. Because quantum computers are not just a classical computer that runs faster, it means that quantum will not replace classical computers. If you have a classical algorithm that does not scale exponentially and works well for the problem you have, there's no reason why you would replace it with a quantum computer because they're generally slower and generally more expensive.

[![Thumbnail 210](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/210.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=210)

 The second point is that many use cases of quantum computers are hidden by definition. If you look around at your company and think about what applications a quantum computer could be used for, chances are there are some applications you don't see because they are not possible to solve with classical computers today. By definition, we want to apply quantum computing to problems that are hard for classical computers. The final point is that because we're talking about a new class of algorithms, these applications are not just lift and shift. When we have a quantum computer at some point in the future that can address industry-relevant problems, we cannot just take what we were running on a classical computer before and move it over to a quantum computer and have it work. These are completely new algorithms, completely new primitives, and it requires a lot of talent, skills, and intellectual property to develop these kinds of algorithms. We're very excited about these algorithms.

[![Thumbnail 220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=220)

### Applications Across Industries and the Current State of Quantum Computing



[![Thumbnail 310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=310)

We're very excited about these algorithms because they're applicable  to a wide field of verticals. We already talked about the home turf kind of problems on the left-hand side, like problems where we try to describe nature for all intents and purposes in physics and chemistry, simulating molecules and reactions, developing new materials and material science. But perhaps very surprisingly, it doesn't stop there. Quantum computers are not only exponentially faster for these types of problems, but there are also certain problems that are inherently classical where it has been shown that quantum computers do provide an advantage.

[![Thumbnail 380](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/380.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=380)

[![Thumbnail 400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=400)

The most famous one is in cryptography, where Shor's algorithm showed that you can factor large numbers exponentially faster than with a classical computer. There's relevance for RSA and encryption, but there are also problems in the space of optimization, and machine learning is a little bit more nuanced here with a lot of research being done in those topics. All of this is to say that we at AWS really think quantum computing is a foundational compute technology.  Like with other compute technologies, we want to bring these capabilities to our customers and, in the fullness of time, make them part of our offering, our compute fabric at AWS.  In some sense, our job at AWS is to make quantum computing boring.

[![Thumbnail 420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=420)

[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=430)

When you look at the accelerated compute portfolio at AWS, we have different types of accelerators, from GPUs to AI and ML accelerators, ASICs and FPGAs, and so on from different providers.  In the fullness of time, I think quantum is just another type of accelerator. Of course, it's a long journey to that place, and to be realistic, I want to stress that the technology is early.  Today there is no quantum computer that can solve any industry-relevant problem faster, cheaper, or more accurately than the best classical alternative.

[![Thumbnail 450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/450.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=450)

So what are customers using quantum computers for today?  Well, quantum computing will not start with broad-scale adoption, but it will start from niche applications and gradually grow from there. I like to make the analogy with GPUs. GPUs started for a very niche application space of graphics processing, until researchers in academia realized they could be used for mathematical calculations and big matrix multiplications, until they finally achieved broad-scale adoption through AI and machine learning. In the same way, quantum computers today are being used by most of our customers to study quantum computing itself.

[![Thumbnail 510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=510)

Customers are researching the devices and the sources of noise, developing error mitigation protocols, and researching novel types of algorithms, trying to understand how they converge and how they are impacted by noise. They're trying to close the gap between what the hardware brings from the bottom and what applications come from the top.  But ultimately, we don't want to just study the hammer. We want to actually use the hammer, using quantum computers as a tool to solve problems in other domains. The first areas where we will solve different kinds of problems will be in the space of scientific applications, driving new scientific discovery in high-energy physics, in material science, in quantum materials, and so on, before we go into this final step into broadly industry-relevant problems with broad-scale adoption.

[![Thumbnail 590](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/590.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=590)

### AWS Quantum Technologies: Four Pillars and the AWS Center for Quantum Computing

 We are at a very exciting time in the industry. We are just at that cusp of going over from studying the hammer to actually using the hammer. Against that backdrop, I wanted to introduce you to what we're doing at AWS to help accelerate that technology and help make that promise of quantum computing a reality. In a nutshell, our quantum technologies at AWS have four pillars. This is Amazon Braket, our quantum computing service.  You're going to hear about that more. We have the Amazon Advanced Solutions Lab, which is a professional services team that focuses on quantum computing and related classical technologies. And then we have the AWS Center for Quantum Computing, a research facility where we're developing our own quantum computing hardware and quantum error correction technologies.

[![Thumbnail 630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=630)

We also have our post-quantum cryptography team and quantum networking team that are part of AWS Core Networking. Let's start with a brief overview of the AWS Center for Quantum Computing, which is an AWS research center located at Caltech. 

We are building our own quantum computing hardware there with a quantum error correction first approach. We really want to address the next level of scaling that is required to take the technology from studying the hammer to using the hammer. We're building on a technology called Cat Qubits, which combines superconducting qubits with microwave resonators to suppress certain types of noise. I'll talk a little bit more about that on the next slide.

[![Thumbnail 670](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/670.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=670)

Just at the beginning of the year, we showed and published results from our first prototype called Ocelot.  There's a picture of the chip here. Through this Cat-Qubit architecture, we were able to suppress a certain type of noise to a degree where the resources required to implement error correction on this architecture is ten times lower than in the traditional approach. We're very excited about these results.

Of course, our approach is only one of many. There are many other promising directions from building quantum computers with trapped ions, building quantum computers with neutral Rydberg atoms or photons, and many others. At the same time, we believe that we need to bring this technology into the hands of our customers so that they can experiment with it, start developing algorithms, and begin developing intellectual property around how we can bring new applications and their resource requirements further down.

[![Thumbnail 740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/740.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=740)

[![Thumbnail 770](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/770.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=770)

That was the reason we launched Amazon Braket in 2020.  We wanted to democratize quantum computing and bring different types of quantum computers into the hands of our customers so that they can learn, experiment, and conduct research into applications. They can envision how quantum computers will be used in the context of AWS and in the context of existing HPC pipelines. Today, we provide access to third-party quantum computers and in the future also our own AWS-built quantum computers, all in one consistent experience. 

[![Thumbnail 800](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/800.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=800)

[![Thumbnail 830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=830)

The quantum computers we have available today are from five different providers.  We have two ion trap providers: IonQ and Alpine Quantum Technology, or AQT. We have two providers building superconducting QPUs: Rigetti and IQM. Finally, we have a provider building Rydberg-based quantum computers: QuEra.  We want to give customers the choice and the ability to contrast and compare the different approaches. Each has different pros and different cons. It is not clear that this is a winner-take-all market by any means. There are many different potential applications for each of these technologies because they all have very different characteristics and different programming paradigms. We want to give customers visibility into the technology.

### Amazon Braket Architecture and National Quantum Initiatives

Let's take a look at a twenty-thousand-foot view of Amazon Braket. We think about Bracket in three different layers. At the bottom, you have the infrastructure and the access modes. We are providing access to QPUs, to quantum circuit simulators, as well as to the classical compute that is used with quantum computers in tandem. We can access these quantum computers in different access modes. For example, on-demand, where you pay-as-you-go as you use it from AWS. You can also make reservations where you get dedicated time on a particular device where only you can access it at the time that suits you.

[![Thumbnail 880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=880)

[![Thumbnail 900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=900)

In the middle part of the stack, we're providing the interfaces and capabilities.  From Jupyter IDEs to programming tools and compilers and a feature for executing quantum hybrid algorithms with hybrid jobs. Then finally, at the top of the layer, we want to bring different types of tooling to our customers that they are used to and want to use.  We are supporting all of the major quantum computing frameworks from IBM's Qiskit to Pennylane and NVIDIA's CUDA Quantum, or CUDA Q, as well as a whole list of software tooling and programming frameworks from our partners.

Many of them are here at re:Invent today and giving their presentations. I encourage everybody to check that out. Essentially, we're realizing we can't build it all on our own, and we want to make sure that anything runs on Braket and we bring the tooling to our customers that they want to use.

[![Thumbnail 950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=950)

Throughout that stack, we are constantly trying to improve the performance, make the user experience better, and get more throughput performance and quality performance out of these early stage devices. There's a lot we could talk about with the different capabilities.  I picked out a feature that we just recently launched: Amazon Braket Program Sets. The way you interact with a quantum computer is not that you send a single program and get it back and analyze it. In reality, a very common workload pattern is that you send multiple programs that either are related to each other, can be the same, can be somehow connected, or also completely independent.

[![Thumbnail 990](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/990.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=990)

[![Thumbnail 1020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1020.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1020)

For each program that you send, you need to compile it, you need to have the I/O overhead of bringing it down to the control system of the QPU, load it onto the FPGA, and so forth. There is overhead in each of those steps.  With Program Sets, we're enabling customers to submit multiple quantum programs, a whole series of quantum programs in a single payload with a single API call. This allows us to optimize that payload, compile it, and gain efficiencies through compilation and the I/O process by bringing multiple programs at the same time onto the FPGA. For certain types of workloads, we're seeing up to 24x speedups with this feature. 

[![Thumbnail 1030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1030)

[![Thumbnail 1060](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1060.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1060)

[![Thumbnail 1080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1080)

With that, I want to come back to this inverted pyramid of use cases.  As we discussed before, we think that the first use cases will be in the scientific domain before we go into broad industry adoption. I don't want to downplay this as a mere stepping stone because I think it's a very profound fact that quantum computers will change the way that we understand nature and how nature behaves at the microscopic level. A recent study from NERSC, which is a supercomputing facility from the Department of Energy,  found that at least 50% of their production workload has the potential to be exponentially accelerated by quantum computers. There's a tremendous opportunity to accelerate research and scientific work through quantum computing directly. 

[![Thumbnail 1120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1120)

Many countries and governments around the world are realizing this opportunity. This was one study from NERSC. Other studies, for example from LANL, find numbers between 30 and 50%. Countries around the world are realizing that this is an opportunity to accelerate scientific breakthroughs and have founded national quantum initiatives to find those first use cases and then also use it as a stepping stone for further industry adoption. A number of those government initiatives and national initiatives are building with Amazon Braket.  The first thing that they want to have is to give access to quantum computers to their local research communities. With Amazon Braket, they get access to HPC resources and quantum computers on demand. We build scalable and secure research environments as well as tailored administrative and budget controls to run large-scale research organizations in the cloud.

[![Thumbnail 1160](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1160.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1160)

For example, we're working with the NQCH in Singapore, with the NQCC in the UK, QCloud in Ireland, and POSI in Australia. As a matter of fact, we just launched—POSI just launched—the quantum hub portal which provides researchers access to quantum computing  and classical computing resources through AWS with tailored administrative controls. They're now starting to run the Zettonics QPilot where they will allocate quantum computing resources for local researchers to drive that innovation flywheel. We're super excited about initiatives like this because we think there's a lot of research to be done, and by having access to real quantum computers, that research can accelerate. Of course, we are all very excited about bringing that technology also out of academia into broad industry adoption, and Michael is going to tell us more about that idea and how we're going to drive our customer engagement. Take it away, Michael.

### Enterprise Adoption: From Research to Industrial Applications

Thank you. Well, thanks very much, Eric. Wonderful introduction to Amazon Braket as a service.  Eric and I work very closely together. He builds and operates the Amazon Braket service and makes it available to our customers so they can use it through the AWS console. It's a service that's available in the cloud for you today. You can access quantum computers just the way you would any other service on AWS.

If you enjoy using EC2, you're going to love using Amazon Braket because it's just another service, but we've got quantum computers on there. My job is to talk to our enterprise customers about where quantum computing is headed and how they will be able to make use of this in the future, the kind of workloads they'll be interested in, and the thinking they need to go through now to prepare their strategies for quantum computing in the future.

Most of our customers today on Amazon Braket are researchers, as Eric mentioned. They're national labs, they're hubs, and they are individual researchers at universities. Most of them are doing science. They come to AWS to use the infrastructure we have available to do good science. They're collecting data, doing physics research, doing computer science research, and doing application and benchmarking style research.

[![Thumbnail 1320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1320)

As we build up this stack, we move from the science to looking more at solving industrial scientific use cases. We'll give an example in a moment about drug discovery, but also think about materials design and production opportunities. But at the big scale and where we want to get to is how we use quantum computers for large-scale enterprise problems in exactly the same way that we use high-performance compute classically today at AWS. 

Some companies are really starting to invest in this ahead of the curve. There are a few leaders out there that are really investing in quantum computing and understanding those use cases and where the potential might be. One of those companies is JPMorgan Chase. We actually have another breakout session tomorrow, which I encourage you to come to, with JPMorgan Chase, where we will go through exactly how we operate the end-to-end application study and benchmarking work that we've been doing with them for the past year.

Their motivation is really clear. Marco Pistoia, who until very recently led the quantum computing program at JPMorgan Chase, said, "If a company doesn't do anything about the market right now, when quantum advantage becomes real, it might be too late." This is really important. This is a fast-moving technology. This is not just a lift and shift from an existing HPC workload to a quantum compute workload.

[![Thumbnail 1400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1400)

These are complex algorithms and complex problems. They take some thinking to work through to design new approaches to running quantum classical hybrid work and running workflows together. The leading organizations in enterprise adoption of quantum compute are really thinking about this now  in anticipation of that future potential advantage.

Here's the journey that we go through with them. We look through a discovery process around use cases, helping them identify the kinds of workloads that are well-suited to a quantum computer. We then research and benchmark with them the quantum computing algorithms. We compare quantum on quantum. How does one quantum computing hardware system compare to another quantum computing hardware system? We also compare quantum and classical together. How does the best available classical approach to that problem match with the quantum computing approach to that? And then we look at the hybrid opportunities.

What if we combine different things together and orchestrate across multiple different platforms on AWS to explore this space? That's what pushing the boundaries is all about. How do we unlock the potential of end-to-end compute, using a quantum computer to make classical computers go faster? That will lay the groundwork for us for production applications in the future.

### Quantum Embark and Advanced Solutions Lab: Getting Started with Quantum Computing

Bringing all this together, we want our customers to be prepared so that as soon as Amazon Braket gets bigger and we have more capacity and we're scaling up across multiple regions, you are ready with your workloads to jump straight into that. Last year at re:Invent, we launched a program called Quantum Embark.  Quantum Embark is our entry point for any enterprise customers to just get started with quantum computing.

If you're not quite sure what to do, you know you should do something, but you're not sure what that something should be, this is the program for you. It is a twelve-week, fixed-price, fixed-scope program to just get started in quantum computing and work with our teams to work through that process that I just described on the last slide. We do use case discovery, some training and enablement together, and then a deep dive on one particular problem.

Let's pick one problem from your organization and solve it together. We go through the process to write out the quantum computing algorithms, compare it to the classical algorithms, fit it onto a quantum computer on Amazon Braket, benchmark it quantum to classical and quantum to quantum. That process takes about 12 weeks.

We work as a joint team together, so some of our solution architects and applied science specialists around quantum computing, along with some of your team, bring that together. The whole idea is that we're able to give you and your executive teams actionable outcomes without the hype.  There's a lot of hype and excitement around quantum computing, and for good reason, but how do we make it real for your particular organization? The Quantum Embark program is all about that—giving you actionable outcomes so that you can understand if and when quantum computing is going to have an impact on your business, and then you can start to inform the rest of the stakeholders across your company about where that's headed.

Going a little bit deeper, we have a team called the Advanced Solutions Lab. This is our professional services team that engages directly with customers  to do long-term R&D engagements around quantum computing. Our colleague Martin Schutz from the Advanced Solutions Lab will be on stage tomorrow at the breakout session I was mentioning with JP Morgan Chase to talk about exactly this. They had a three-year program of effort looking at multiple problems across quantum computing at every level, from optimization of how to use particular devices to compilation strategies to application benchmarking.

This is a deep research team that will design a custom R&D engagement for your particular needs. They'll work with you to develop and explore novel quantum computing algorithms. We'll look at opportunities to deliver business value today on classical compute hardware, but most importantly, generate that intellectual property so that you have the know-how and the IP to take advantage of quantum computing as it matures over time.

### Hybrid Quantum-Classical Workflows: The AstraZeneca Drug Discovery Case Study

Now let's take a look at what quantum computing means  for our entire accelerated compute portfolio. If you are a user of AWS's high-performance compute services, where does quantum computing fit into that overall landscape? The good news is that in some ways, Amazon Braket and quantum computing  is just another instance of compute on AWS. It's just another type of accelerated computing. We have CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerated processors like Trainium and Inferentia. Quantum computing is just one more type of computer in that overall portfolio.

We've been doing a lot of work this year to integrate Amazon Braket as another instance type within the high-performance compute services of AWS. You might be familiar with the Parallel Compute Service, AWS Batch, and Parallel Cluster. These are for classical HPC. If you're Formula One, if you're Ferrari, and you need to do computational fluid dynamics, those are the services you're using to do those large industrial-scale heavy compute workloads on AWS. They don't go directly to EC2 to spin up instances. They use these orchestration tools to do those large-scale problems.

We're looking at how to integrate Amazon Braket directly into that. You should be able to go straight to the high-performance compute services and spin up accelerated compute instances of multiple different types that include quantum computing and orchestrate across that entire end-to-end workflow over time. We've been doing a lot of work to integrate that into the systems, and the example I'm going to show you in a moment is based on exactly that framework.

Think about AWS as the core infrastructure with compute, networking, and storage. Amazon Braket is just another form of compute on there with different abilities to consume that compute over time. On our classical infrastructure, we have on-demand, capacity blocks, spot, and reserve instances. We're building out exactly the same for Amazon Braket over time as well. Right now, you can log into the console and access Amazon Braket on-demand, paying only for what you use with no upfront commitment to use a quantum computer, or you can reserve a capacity block next Tuesday at 3 p.m. to do your particular workload.

[![Thumbnail 1780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1780)

We really are thinking about quantum computing as just another computer within the framework that you're already used to running large-scale workloads on AWS.  Let's take a look at what a large-scale end-to-end industrial strength workflow looks like. This is a very typical workflow for one of our high-performance compute customers. They might be doing drug discovery, computational fluid dynamics, some kind of engineering analysis, circuit layout, or something like that. There will be some user action process right at the top that will flow down to an execution plan, there will be some I/O on there, and there will be an orchestration layer handling different types of compute.

[![Thumbnail 1830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1830)

But all of this numerical heavy lifting could be a couple of hours of work, a couple of weeks of work, or a couple of months of work. We see everything in between. The idea of quantum computing is, what if we could interleave some parts of that overall workflow that are well-suited to a quantum computer  so we're still doing quantum and classical together, but in a hybrid modality? Can we get an end-to-end speedup? Can we reduce the entire operational end-to-end workflow of a large-scale high-performance compute workload and get a faster result for our customers and hopefully a lower cost result as well?

[![Thumbnail 1860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1860)

[![Thumbnail 1870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1870)

We're at the very early stages of putting this into practice. We've got a great example with our customer AstraZeneca that we worked with earlier this year  to explore exactly this kind of problem. This was a joint program between AstraZeneca, IonQ , the quantum computing hardware company, NVIDIA, and AWS. So it was four companies working together, looking at the algorithm problems, the orchestration problems, and how we bring that back together as an end-to-end workflow to see what kind of result we could get.

The particular problem we were looking at was a chemistry problem called transition metal catalysis. This underpins so much of what happens in modern drug design and is part of the everyday workflow that every drug company in the world goes through. It's a really tough computational problem to solve because it's very difficult for a classical computer to simulate. As the complexity of these molecules grows, the amount of connections between them also increases exponentially, making it harder and harder to simulate. But if we could simulate these accurately and early, we could identify new synthesis routes before going to the wet lab, before mixing chemicals together to see what would actually happen.

[![Thumbnail 1940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/1940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=1940)

The particular chemistry problem we looked at was the oxidative addition and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling with a nickel catalyst . The idea here is that we're looking at a catalytic process. We're going from the B state up to the BC state and then down to the C state. That's an energy barrier that we need to get over. We're modeling what happens in the real world in real chemistry, a quantum mechanical process going over this energy barrier through a catalytic state. The height of that barrier determines whether this reaction is going to run at all. If it's too high, when we go into the wet lab, that's not going to come together as the molecule we want. So we want to understand before we go to the lab the height of that barrier and what the end state is going to be.

[![Thumbnail 2000](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/2000.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=2000)

[![Thumbnail 2030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/2030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=2030)

Solving that problem is really tough. This is the classical workflow for it . We start with calculating an active space, and then there's something called the trial wave function, which is one of the hardest parts of this overall state. This is where the quantum bonds are being understood by the computers. Then we hand it off to classical systems to run some Monte Carlo analysis and find the overall energy state at the end. But it turns out that we can replace one part of this workflow  with a quantum computing algorithm instead.

[![Thumbnail 2060](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/2060.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=2060)

Working together, AstraZeneca, NVIDIA, IonQ, and AWS said, what if we went classical, quantum, classical? We adapt the classical algorithm to better suit a quantum computer and then we also adapt the classical workload that happens afterwards. Can we get a better result from that over time? We took a look at adapting that trial wave function preparation  on the IonQ Forte-1 machine. At the time we ran this, this was the latest device we had. We ran what we think was the largest scale quantum compute workload that's ever been run on these systems, fitting those molecules through that energy state transition onto the quantum computer and doing a whole bunch of sampling around that.

We then moved those results over to classical post-processing using AWS Parallel Cluster, one of our high-performance compute services. We ran the Monte Carlo simulations to find the final energy state. We used a lot of compute to do this. We used 40 P5 EN instances, which are the H100 instances from NVIDIA, running compute for a couple of days.

So it was a big workload. The end-to-end state here, we think, is the largest end-to-end workload that's ever been run quantum and classical together. And the results are really promising.

[![Thumbnail 2120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/2120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=2120)

### Results, Future Outlook, and How to Engage with AWS Quantum Computing



What this chart is showing, on the x-axis is the system size, essentially the size of the molecules, the size of the atoms that we're looking at. So bigger and bigger molecules as we go out to the right-hand side. And on the y-axis is the runtime in seconds on a log scale. So more processing time to get there. The dashed lines that you see were the previous best available classical results that we had from this. So as these molecules got bigger, the previous best classical systems were in those dashed lines there.

The solid line is what we're able to produce classically on this hybrid workflow. So the particular solid dot that's in the middle there is this particular result, right in the middle. So that gap between the solid dot on the solid line and the lowest level of the dashed line, that is the performance increase that we're able to get between these two workloads. And that is a 656 times speedup over that part of the processing cycle that we went through there. So a really significant result.

Now, this isn't something that we could put in production. When we had to play a lot of tricks on our system to make this work, we had to learn a lot about the orchestration of running a hybrid workload on AWS. And it took a lot of compute to do this. So we can't run this in production every day. Also, we weren't looking at the cost around it. But it gives us a lot of confidence that as we're building out these systems, as we get bigger and bigger, as we're able to do more and more sophisticated orchestration across high-performance compute, that as these molecules get bigger, we're going to see a huge performance increase that we're going to be able to deliver to customers there.

[![Thumbnail 2250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/2250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=2250)

So as we extrapolate out to molecules like FeMoCo that are really important to problems in industrial processing and nitrogen fixation, and hopefully, eventually, things like fertilizer production, that we're going to be able to model these systems in a really interesting way. So I just want to remind everyone of something  that Eric said right at the top of the presentation, that no quantum computer today can solve an industry-relevant problem faster, cheaper, or more accurately than the best available classical alternative. That is still true. The example that I showed you before does not yet meet these criteria. But it's a stepping stone to that.

[![Thumbnail 2300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/2300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=2300)

We can really see and have a lot of confidence around where this is headed. As these computers get bigger, as they get more capable, we are going to be able to tick off these things, to be able to go faster, to be able to go cheaper, to be able to do things more accurately than the best available classical alternative, and be able to do it in production over time as well. So what can you do today? How do you take action around this? Well, this is what the leading companies are doing. They're generating IP. They're generating the algorithms that will run on these quantum computers. They're generating the know-how  about how to operate it in the cloud.

And so you can do that too. You can get engaged with us or with our partner network and explore what the intellectual property portfolio looks like that will have an impact on your compute solutions. You can engage the supply chain. You're understanding the quantum computing hardware companies, understanding the software libraries, the open source community, the partners that are out there, the university researchers that are engaged in this. You're having a deep understanding of where your compute is going to come from, where your algorithms are going to come from, where your software library is going to come from. It's an important part of the puzzle.

[![Thumbnail 2360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/2360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=2360)

And then finally, build a workforce. Have a few people within your organization who can understand this technology, who can make sense of it for your particular organization, who can start to read the news and be able to process it in a way that's relevant to you and be able to react quickly as computers get more and more capable over time. And so we're here to help you do that. We've got a lot of options available  for you to engage with us at AWS on quantum compute.

In the middle is Amazon Braket. This is an operational service in general availability on AWS today. We've been running this for five years. You can access quantum computers in the cloud this afternoon if you'd like. We actually have a series of workshops this week so you can get hands-on with quantum computing in one of our workshops through the rest of these sessions. Couple of other options. We've got a digital badge available on AWS Skill Builder. You can work through a course, get a digital badge through that.

[![Thumbnail 2420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dae99c2221120c5d/2420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqb5i8RxmwE&t=2420)

Quantum Embark we talked about before for enterprise customers to engage in quantum computing. The Advanced Solutions Lab if you want to do a deeper project. And then Amazon Braket Direct is our program so that you can work directly with our hardware suppliers as well. So if you want to engage on a particular problem with IonQ or Rigetti or AQT or QuEra or IQM, you can do it through that program. So a lot of different ways to engage. And then finally, just to wrap up,  we've got a lot of sessions on quantum compute this week. This is just a selection. All of the sessions that we've got on quantum computer through the QR code there.

But I've just put a selection on the slide here so that if you want to follow up on this and go a little bit deeper, please come to the breakout session tomorrow with JPMorgan Chase and look at the applications in the financial sector. We've got some chalk talks that go into hybrid compute, into how we're using generative AI to accelerate quantum computing software development. And then finally, a little bit more on hubs, which is what Eric was talking about before with those national compute resource centers and how we're integrating in with them. So we're delighted that you can make it along today to this session to learn a little bit more about what we're doing in quantum technologies at AWS. And we hope to see you on Amazon Braket in the future. Thank you very much.
