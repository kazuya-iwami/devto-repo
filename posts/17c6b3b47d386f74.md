### Welcome to re:Invent: Introducing Cloud Governance Foundations

 Well, good afternoon. Thank you all for being here. Thursday of re:Invent, we're coming up on the end. Hope everybody has had a great week as you put your headsets on. Hopefully everybody has had a great week and done all of the great re:Invent things: networking, learning, having the Vegas experience and doing it all. I will put in a plug. Hopefully you've saved a little bit of energy for the re:Play party tonight. For me it's always a fun way to kind of wrap the business part of the week and have some fun celebrating what's happened. So I always love to find out people's experience at re:Invent.

How many are here for their first ever re:Invent? Wow, lots of first timers. That's fantastic. Love it. Welcome. Hopefully it's been a good week and you're already booking your flight for next year. How many on the other end, five or more? Six, seven? All right, awesome. So these are veterans you newcomers can see that they've had a good time and they keep coming back. Well again, thank you so much for being here.

By way of introduction, my name is Tim Honychurch. I am a Principal Specialist in Cloud Governance here at AWS. I'll be joined later in the presentation by our valued customer, Dustin Jefford of Eli Lilly and Company, and then my colleague here at AWS, Alex Merida. But I have the privilege of getting us started and  we'll do that by taking a quick look at our agenda. I'm going to spend the first part of the presentation laying down the foundation of what cloud governance is and how it relates to the topics that Dustin and Alex will be talking about.

Dustin's going to come up and tell a real life story. This is one of our favorite things to do: tell a real life story about problems to be solved, solutions that were available, how that process went, and then what the outcome was. So we're looking forward to hearing from Dustin about what it meant for Eli Lilly. And then Alex will come in and do some more detailed deep dive on some of the technical elements of that solution that Eli Lilly employed. So three parts, and hopefully it all connects for you and you come away with some things that are useful that you can take back to your operations. So does that sound good? All right, ready? Let's get into it.

[![Thumbnail 150](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/150.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=150)

[![Thumbnail 170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=170)

So you know one of the things that we love to talk about at AWS  is the speed of innovation that is enabled by the cloud, right? So customers come to us because they want to move faster. They have business projects, objectives, outcomes that they're looking for, and they want to take advantage of some key characteristics of the cloud to help them get there. You know, one is to move faster, and  what we'll be talking about today is how we enable these capabilities through our cloud governance services that are part of Eli Lilly's story.

[![Thumbnail 200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/200.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=200)

[![Thumbnail 220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=220)

So from a moving faster perspective, our customers want to utilize capabilities like auto scaling and dynamic resource provisioning to be able to add resources quickly as part of their development process and not be slowed down by legacy IT type of operations. Agility is  key. Our customers want to be agile. They want to be able to move quickly in their development cycles, spin up resources to be able to do what they need to do in their projects without being bogged down by operational requirements and centralized IT. And they also want to be able to scale, right? You want to  get big and you want to get fast and you want to be efficient.

[![Thumbnail 250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=250)

You want to be able to deploy policies such as S3 bucket encryption across all of your S3 buckets, maybe thousands of them across hundreds of accounts, and you want to be able to do that in one motion using scaled capabilities. And those are the things we'll be talking about today in our presentation. Before we get too far into it though, I do want to lay a bit of a foundational definition  of cloud governance. So in my role and in what we do here at AWS, we look at cloud governance as a way to enable you to take advantage of the things that the cloud offers.

[![Thumbnail 290](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/290.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=290)

You came here to do something specific, and we like to use the capabilities and governance to help you get there, to align your use of the cloud with those business objectives. And while we talk about cloud governance kind of as a topic, we know it's made up of some interconnected components. So there's a security element, there's an operations element, there's a compliance element and a cost element, and we like to orchestrate these things with cloud governance capabilities to help you move faster  while also adhering to the requirements and the standards that you have across those domains. So as we get into the more technical content, just be thinking about that definition, right? A set of tools and capabilities that helps you align your use of the cloud with what you're trying to achieve.

[![Thumbnail 310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=310)

### Common Cloud Governance Challenges: Resources, Controls, and Compliance

 But we know that implementing these things is not necessarily easy or automatic, and you'll hear from Dustin that there's work involved in accomplishing what they were able to accomplish. One of my favorite things about the role that I have now at AWS is that I talk to customers a lot, and I hear from customers about what they're trying to achieve, what the challenges are in their world, the unique requirements, and what they're trying to customize to help them solve problems for their business. And then I have the ability to go back to our service teams and say, hey, I talked to these customers, this is what they need, and be able to advocate for customers in future roadmaps and capabilities in our services.

So these challenges are what we're hearing from customers, and I also had the opportunity to experience that when I was a customer. I was a customer for about eight years, part of a team that built a SaaS security platform in AWS, and like many of you may have experienced, we started with three developers and one account and scaled that out to hundreds of accounts and very complex services that served our customers. So we experienced some of these challenges as part of that as well, and I'll note that the challenges that I'm going to share here and talk through are just the tip of the iceberg. We know there's many more, but these are very common from what we've heard.

[![Thumbnail 400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=400)

The first is  resources. Does anybody here have more human resource capacity than they know what to do with, more budget for tools than you know what to do with? I don't see any hands raised, right? In fact, it's quite the opposite. Everybody's struggling to be able to get more done with less and less, particularly as we enter the AI age, and the expectation is that you can utilize technologies like that to help you do even more with even less. So we know that implementing the principles that we're talking about today, the solutions, is a challenge because we need resources to be able to do that, so that's acknowledged.

[![Thumbnail 440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=440)

[![Thumbnail 460](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/460.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=460)

 The second is being able to, as we get into more detail about cloud governance, when you think about implementing controls across those four domains we mentioned across an entire environment, being able to define those, deploy those, and maintain those is not an easy thing to do, and we acknowledge  that. Third, when we think about that agile development cycle and supporting a culture of agility, we recognize there's a balance point. There's a balance between giving a lot of control and independence to developers, but also on the other end trying to maintain standards and controls from a security and cost and compliance perspective, so maintaining that balance is always tricky.

[![Thumbnail 490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=490)

And then lastly, and certainly not least,  is maintaining compliance with ever-evolving standards, and I'm sure you all here are subject to multiple compliance frameworks. Anybody specifically subject to PCI DSS in your world? Okay, so you all probably know that when PCI DSS 4.0 was launched or released in 2022, there were 60 new controls added to the framework, right? So when you have that dropped in your lap and now we need to deploy that across a complex environment, that's a very challenging thing to do, and these are things that we acknowledge and we hear from our customers, and we look to bring solutions for.

[![Thumbnail 540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=540)

So the good news is that we look at, again back to our definition, we look at cloud governance as a set of capabilities that helps you  achieve things and overcome some of these challenges. And what I'll be doing is walking through, calling out four characteristics of Cloud Governance Foundation in AWS that will reflect some of what Dustin and Lily went through in their transformation. So let's take a look at those.

[![Thumbnail 560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/560.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=560)

### Four Key Characteristics of AWS Cloud Governance: Managed, Controlled, Agile, and Scalable

 The first characteristic that we want to emphasize is AWS cloud services provide managed capabilities. So if you're familiar with AWS Control Tower, you know that it can deploy, configure, and maintain for you up to 14 different underlying services, and that relieves the pressure from you of having to do that deployment, configuration, and ongoing management yourself. So examples would be AWS Organizations, IAM Identity Center, and AWS Config, which if you think about Config just by itself, there's a lot of complexity in being able to deploy that and manage it to your standards.

[![Thumbnail 610](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/610.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=610)

AWS Control Tower can do a lot of that heavy lifting for you as a managed service as it continues to be updated behind the scenes by our teams. So managed is number one. 

[![Thumbnail 640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/640.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=640)

Number two, controlled. We talked about controls deploying across a complex environment. Also, part of Control Tower is a set of built-in controls ready for you off the shelf to be able to deploy across your environment. So proactive controls, detective controls, preventive controls are there for you to implement according to your needs without having the need to build them and deploy them by yourself. 

Back to agility, so we think about again that tricky balance and we'll use the account provisioning and resource provisioning as our example. Being able to use automation and infrastructure as code to allow your developers to deploy the resources that they need, but doing so in a controlled way according to your requirements is really a critical element, and that's a lot of what we'll be talking about today. Using Account Factory for Terraform to do deployments for you according to preset conditions that you want, enabling that agility.

[![Thumbnail 680](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/680.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=680)

And then last is scalability,  being able to deploy a requirement at scale across an entire scope of accounts and resources in one motion. We'll talk again about Account Factory for Terraform and how it enables you to manage a large and complex environment, multiple accounts and resources in one motion. So based on those four characteristics, we're going to have Dustin come up and walk through a transformation that Eli Lilly and Company went through to modernize their cloud governance environment.

### Eli Lilly's Journey: From AWS Landing Zone to Control Tower and Account Factory for Terraform

Thank you Tim. Good afternoon everyone. My name is Dustin Jefford. I am the Cloud Platform or Cloud Foundation Lead at Eli Lilly and Company for our AWS platform. Today I'm going to talk to you, as Tim mentioned, about our journey into modern cloud governance, specifically  our transition from the legacy AWS Landing Zone or ALZ solution into Control Tower and Account Factory for Terraform. 

But first, a little bit about who we are. Lilly unites caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the world. Founded in 1876 and headquartered in Indianapolis, we employ more than 44,000 people worldwide. We do clinical research in more than 55 countries and we market our products globally. With the global scale of our business, we require governance technologies that are robust, scalable, and ready to adapt to the constant changing demands of working around the world.

[![Thumbnail 800](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/800.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=800)

[![Thumbnail 820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=820)

Our journey in central cloud governance and organization management really began in 2018 when we adopted the ALZ or  the AWS Landing Zone. At the time, Lilly was expanding rapidly into the cloud, as I'm sure a lot of businesses were, and we needed a way for our central teams to manage that expansion so that developers and application teams could use those services safely. However, the very next year,  AWS released Control Tower, and while we were very excited to see a managed solution become available, we had already invested very heavily in Landing Zone.

At the time we were managing somewhere between 400 and 500 AWS accounts in our organization and offering three to four standard account patterns. We had also tied some critical foundational automation to the Landing Zone, so network configurations and identity management permissions. And so we decided at that time to continue to invest in Landing Zone until Control Tower could mature to meet some of our needs.

[![Thumbnail 870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=870)

And that continued all the way up through 2023  with the final release of the AWS Landing Zone. By that point we were up to I think six standard account patterns, numerous ad hoc custom account patterns, and somewhere between 1,400 and 1,500 AWS accounts as we continued to grow in scale. The initial advantages we found with the ALZ service, the ability to deploy configuration changes across all of our accounts at scale, became a hindrance.

[![Thumbnail 940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=940)

The monolithic pipeline approach of AWS Landing Zone, as we continued to create and grow into the environment, started taking longer and longer to push changes. By the time we hit 2023, a single execution of the pipeline would take us eight hours to complete, and that's assuming that it finished. More often than not, it started to fail. We found and watched the central teams become a bottleneck for innovation for the business. That led us then to 2024  when we made a decision to invest in and modernize our governance solution.

[![Thumbnail 950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=950)

[![Thumbnail 970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=970)

[![Thumbnail 970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=970)

 As we looked at our landscape and looked through what we wanted out of a new solution, we identified a couple of critical requirements.  First, the new solution needed to be a managed solution. As much fun as it was managing  a bespoke custom monolithic giant landing zone, we really didn't want to deal with that operational overhead moving forward.

[![Thumbnail 980](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/980.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=980)

[![Thumbnail 1000](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1000.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1000)

 We needed to enhance and increase agility for both our central teams and for our business teams and service areas. Too often, as I mentioned, we found ourselves being the bottleneck to innovation. We also needed to increase scalability.  The business was not going to stop expanding into the cloud, and we needed to be able to handle the increase as the business continued moving in that direction.

[![Thumbnail 1020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1020.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1020)

[![Thumbnail 1050](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1050.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1050)

 We needed to simplify our governance. I alluded earlier to some critical foundational automation pieces that were tied to some of our early landing zone architecture, and that resulted in overly complex Service Control Policies and really intricate conditional statements. I'll talk a little bit more about that, but we needed to simplify that so that we could adopt new features. That led us to Control Tower with the Account Factory for Terraform. 

[![Thumbnail 1080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1080)

In 2024, we worked with AWS Professional Services to kick off a project to transition all 1,500 accounts and the hundreds of thousands of resources being managed by our foundational code from AWS Landing Zone into Control Tower and AFT.  We kicked off a six-month project beginning at the end of 2024 and going through the beginning of 2025. We picked this time frame because there's lower developer activity at Lilly over the end of the year time frame, and we felt like it would reduce the potential impact to ongoing initiatives and potential product releases. But what that did mean is that we needed to be able to do this quickly so that we didn't impact anything coming in the new year, and we needed to do this transparently. We could not have any downtime or potential for downtime for any of our foundational and centralized services.

[![Thumbnail 1120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1120)

### The Migration Process and Transformative Outcomes at Eli Lilly

 So what does this look like? The first thing we did isn't actually on this slide, but we stood up Control Tower and then we enrolled all of our accounts and Organizational Units into Control Tower. Once we got that finished, or rather in parallel, we went and decoupled our resources from the old CloudFormation stacks  that Landing Zone uses to manage the resources. We did this by updating all of our resource definitions to use the deletion policy retain statement. What that simply means for anyone who doesn't know is that if you then, or when you delete the CloudFormation stacks, the resources remain behind and they don't get deleted. We went back through, and there was a lot of repeated executions of that monolithic pipeline, so it took us a while, but we got all of those resource definitions updated.

[![Thumbnail 1180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1180)

[![Thumbnail 1190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1190)

Then we went and developed Terraform modules  to replace those resource definitions, and this is where we did take some opportunity to simplify some of our automation and decouple some things.  Once we completed that, and those two steps were very much manual, once we completed that, we implemented an automation.

We designed and implemented some Step Functions and Lambdas that did a couple of things for us and helped accelerate this transition. The first thing that it did is it went across the entire environment and scraped all of our deployed stack sets, our foundational deployed stack sets. It pulled in all of the input parameters and output values, sent that over to Amazon Bedrock. I think it was the Claude 3 model at the time, and used AI to generate Terraform import commands.

[![Thumbnail 1250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1250)

[![Thumbnail 1270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1270)

Those commands were then manually validated as they came back to make sure there weren't any unexpected create or delete statements in there. Once we validated that, we approved the continuation of the script execution,  and the script executed those imports for us and generated a series of state files. We then took those state files and uploaded those to the Account Factory for Terraform code base  and registered each account with AFT. Then the script executed those AFT pipelines, and Alex will talk a little bit more about what that looks like in detail.

[![Thumbnail 1310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1310)

But once those pipelines were executed, we got a second or a third piece of validation that no resources were being destroyed or changed or retained or rebuilt, and effectively it synchronized AFT with the resources deployed. So at this point, all resources are now being managed through Control Tower and through Account Factory for Terraform.  And then we went back and we deleted those CloudFormation stacks and decommissioned the ALZ environment.

[![Thumbnail 1350](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1350.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1350)

By using this process, you see three of the steps, the big chunk of the process is automated. By doing this, we were able to move all 1,500 AWS accounts, the tens of thousands of resources associated with those stacks, from ALZ and into Control Tower within six months. That included three months of upfront development time, and then the automated piece took about three months to complete. 

One other advantage I wanted to highlight that we were able to do as part of this, which has resulted in significant benefit for us. When we initially built out the ALZ, as I mentioned, we tied a number of pieces of core foundational functionality to specifically where an account sat within the org hierarchy. So if you were in a dev account, you got dev permissions and a dev set of networking configurations that you could use. This resulted in a very flat OU structure and made things very complicated, very difficult to manage from a central perspective. We had redundant SCPs and very complex SCP conditionals, so not just complex to manage, but complex to expand on.

When new features were released like RCP, or Resource Control Policies, we struggled to get those features implemented. By decoupling that automation from the OU when we refactored our resource definitions into Terraform, it allowed us to adopt a more hierarchical organization and OU structure. We went with a workloads-based architecture for a number of reasons, but what this did allow for is significant reduction in the number of redundant guardrails. It also way simplified SCP configurations, conditionals became very straightforward in the few instances where we still needed them, and it enabled easier onboarding of new patterns.

Prior to this adoption, we had central teams who maybe wanted to host an EKS cluster for the global organization, right? Prior to this, the upfront foundational changes that would be needed to allow EKS to run in the way that they need it to run would take a minimum of one to two months of development time and implementation, executing that eight-hour-long pipeline, adjusting, executing again, promoting to production, executing again, and testing.

With this change, we are now able to set up a new Organizational Unit for a workload that is non-standard and execute and apply any required Service Control Policy changes within the space of a sprint, so two weeks. This represents a significant reduction in implementation time from the central teams.

[![Thumbnail 1540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1540)

So what does this look like from an outcomes perspective?  We achieved a 75% reduction in manual effort and a 300% increase in code push frequency. Faster creation of Organizational Units and feature delivery went from two months down to two weeks. Security and configuration updates can now be deployed across all accounts in under five hours. It's nice to see the percentages up here, but what this looks like in reality for Eli Lilly is that we finished this project in Q1 of 2025. That next quarter, before we had really been able to continue to invest and build out our AWS Control Tower and Account Factory for Terraform presence, we were able to push more configuration changes in that quarter, Q2, than we were able to push in the entirety of the previous year, 2024.

We no longer are a blocker to innovation for our business teams. As much as I can point to these numbers up here, Eli Lilly's journey to modern cloud governance is about more than just technology. It's about empowering our teams and accelerating innovation and ensuring that our infrastructure can keep pace with our mission to improve lives around the world. Now I'll welcome Alex to the stage to talk a little bit more about AWS Control Tower. Thank you.

### AWS Control Tower Deep Dive: Account Factory for Terraform and the Controls-Only Experience

Good afternoon, everybody. A quick question for everyone: how many of you heard about our controls-only experience that launched last week? See, this is like the common thing I've heard all week.  I did a little bit of booth duty on the expo floor the other day, and everyone kept coming up to me saying, "Hey, I want to be able to use landing zones," or "I want to be able to just use managed controls, but I don't want to just set up landing zones."  We're going to get into that a little bit today.

[![Thumbnail 1670](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1670.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1670)

So bringing it all together, first with AWS Control Tower for those that are a little unfamiliar,  we orchestrate a lot of services on your behalf. This allows you to really focus on the security and compliance needs of your organization. You can get started in under 30 minutes or less with AWS Control Tower. Let's walk through a little bit of what we set up for you.

[![Thumbnail 1690](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1690.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1690)

[![Thumbnail 1700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1700)

First, when you set up AWS Control Tower, you're going to get two accounts. You're going to get a Log Archive account, and you're going  to get an Audit account. Both of these accounts help meet your logging and compliance needs within your organization. Next, we're going to set up two Organizational Units for you.  Now you have the ability to make the Sandbox OU optional, but what is not optional is the Security OU, which comes preconfigured with two additional accounts. One has your AWS Backup vaults in it, and the other one's a delegated administrator account where you can manage your AWS Backup service.

[![Thumbnail 1720](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1720)

[![Thumbnail 1740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1740.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1740)

[![Thumbnail 1750](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1750.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1750)

And then last, Account Factory lives within AWS Control Tower.  Account Factory allows you to provision specific types of AWS accounts to your organization using account baseline resources that you've perused from the managed controls catalog and applied to your organization. There are three additional value adds that I want to call out really quickly for AWS Control Tower. Number one,  you do get AWS IAM Identity Center federated access to your applications. Number two, we're going to enable AWS Config  and AWS CloudTrail, and we're going to write those both to a centralized S3 bucket that's located in your Log Archive account. And then last, any of those managed controls that you've turned on for your landing zone will be backed by AWS Security Hub, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS CloudFormation, and that ensures that any newly provisioned accounts do meet those compliance standards that you've set in place already.

[![Thumbnail 1780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1780)

So we talked a little bit about Account Factory in the previous slide, and I do want to talk a  little bit more in depth about that. Account Factory exists to help provision those AWS accounts for you with those preconfigured either security baseline resources or maybe it's some of those managed controls that you put in place. But we also just released a new feature when it comes to Account Factory that allows Account Factory to live completely within AWS Control Tower using the AWS Organizations account primitives, and it no longer requires the previously required Service Catalog integration.

[![Thumbnail 1820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1820)

[![Thumbnail 1830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1830)

So how does this look today? You're going to navigate directly to your AWS management console for Organizations and create your account  there, or you can use the programmatic CreateAccount API from AWS Organizations. Once the account has been provisioned, you're going to move that account to the Control Tower OU.  Once it's placed in that OU, we'll apply any of those managed controls that you selected from the Control Catalog. We'll also put any of those preconfigured services there, such as CloudTrail, Config, Backup, and anything along those lines.

[![Thumbnail 1850](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1850.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1850)

[![Thumbnail 1860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1860)

Now we're going to walk through Account  Factory for Terraform and what that looks like. On the right-hand side of the screen, one of the very specific things that you're going to need is Control Tower deployed.  Next, after that, you're going to set up an Account Factory administration account. This is specifically just for Account Factory. Going back to the right-hand side, I just want to point out here that we did just mention that Service Catalog is no longer required, but for the purposes of this discussion, we're here. The big callout here is that any of your account vending or account orchestration needs are going to occur in that block.

[![Thumbnail 1890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1890)

[![Thumbnail 1910](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1910.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1910)

This is a GitOps-driven model. Essentially, a user  will create an account request file within the Account Factory configuration repository and commit it via git push into the repo. In this scenario, we are using AWS CodeCommit, but we do support any CodeStar connection. Next, once you've pushed that change, it'll activate your CodePipeline  and write those changes to Amazon DynamoDB. This gives you a traceability plan for any of those changes.

[![Thumbnail 1920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1920)

[![Thumbnail 1940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1940)

Next, Account Factory is going to communicate  with AWS Control Tower to figure out does this account need to be updated, or do I need to provision a new account. If yes, it'll go directly to Control Tower to make those vending requests and vend your account as specified. If it doesn't need to do that, it's going to go straight to applying some of those customizations that you've already defined,  maybe some of those networking configurations that you want specific to your organization, or maybe some security guardrails that you set up in the very beginning. All of that occurs there.

[![Thumbnail 1950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1950)

[![Thumbnail 1970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1970)

And then last, Account Factory  applies defined account-level specific or global customizations using Terraform. When we deploy these configurations within the account, whether it's newly provisioned or updated, the account then meets all of your specific compliance needs or security needs that you're setting forth as an organization.  So now that you've heard about Account Factory, you've heard a little bit about Terraform, how it's technically executed, and how Eli Lilly is using it, why should you use it?

[![Thumbnail 1980](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/1980.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=1980)

 First, Account Factory customizes new and existing accounts through a pipeline-based workflow. This meets the requirements of your organization to meet scalability or agility needs, as it automates the entire workflow on your behalf. And for customers using Terraform, it fulfills the gap of your infrastructure as code. Number two, deployment and configuration artifacts are stored in version control repositories. This is important because it ensures that you're working with the most up-to-date code, and it gives you traceability of that code. If I have to do a rollback, well, good thing I already have this stored in a repository.

[![Thumbnail 2020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2020.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2020)

[![Thumbnail 2040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2040)

 Third, we support published modules from the Terraform Registry and custom modules. This gives customers a starting point, but it also enables you to fully customize the environment to what you need. You need to tailor it specific to what your requirements are, whether it's your PCI needs, whether you're HIPAA compliant, or any of these other specific compliance frameworks that you're looking for.  And then last, for our really security-minded folks, we support delegated administration. A lot of customers come to us and say, hey, I don't want to log into the management account every day to do specific actions. What can you do to help me here? Well, we have delegated admin for that.

[![Thumbnail 2060](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2060.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2060)

### Shifting Left with Managed Controls and Key Takeaways for Modern Cloud Governance

Next, I want to talk a little about controls  and what that means. Recently, we've heard a lot about shifting to the left. Has anyone ever heard the term shifting to your left in any of your  all-hands meetings or any security meetings? I see a couple of hands in the crowd. Awesome. So we're shifting left from just detective controls.  Detective controls were designed to alert you after an event has already occurred. We're shifting to the left with proactive controls,  controls that are designed to prevent resource mutation from occurring. And going even further, we're shifting farther to the left with preventative controls,  controls that are there to ensure that no bad code is ever shipped to your production environments.

So what does this look like in the Controls Catalog? The Controls Catalog is a single source of truth for AWS managed controls, and soon we're going to have all of the AWS managed controls here. With our recent launch of the controls-only experience, now you can go directly to the Controls Catalog without having to set up that landing zone as a prerequisite. So I can go here, peruse whatever controls I need, any metadata, any of those corresponding compliance frameworks, and apply those controls really easily.

If you need detective controls, you're going to go ahead and activate AWS Config at an account level, at an OU level, or organization-wide. If you want proactive or preventative controls, all you're going to do is enable trusted access and choose what regions you want to operate in as well. It's never been easier to activate some of these managed controls for your environments than today, and I can't emphasize that enough just because I've heard so much from customers this week saying we definitely just want to use controls for our environments. We have such a hard time getting through some of our auditing pieces or looking at these compliance pieces. Well, I very much urge everyone after this session, go and tell your teams, go check out the managed controls.

[![Thumbnail 2200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2200.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2200)

[![Thumbnail 2210](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2210.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2210)

So now that we've talked about a little bit about Account Factory, how it customizes your accounts, the value of managed controls as well, how do we bring them together? You heard Dustin talk about how they migrated to Control Tower and established their Account Factory pipeline infrastructure. Figuring out how to protect your workloads with managed controls is next, so you can deploy those managed controls using Terraform within your Account Factory pipelines to keep resource deployments within a single approach.  How is this beneficial to us? It's simple to manage. You're essentially baking everything into a single pipeline, and that reduces your costs, your operational costs. 

[![Thumbnail 2230](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2230.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2230)

[![Thumbnail 2250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2250)

But it does come back with some drawbacks. So you're going to have your Account Factory administrator is going to have permanent elevated permissions. And secondly, you are taking dependency risk by relying on a single Account Factory pipeline in that scenario. So how does it look again? I'm going to take us back to the architecture slide that I showed  in the very beginning. So any of those deployed controls within your Account Factory pipeline will essentially be baked in the AWS CodeBuild and AWS Step Functions piece where you're applying the customizations directly. But if you want to use Terraform, everything is going to occur in that green box there.  It ensures that deployments are done through a single approach and that you can keep track of where anything is. And I'm going to bring Tim back up to talk about our key takeaways. Thanks everyone.

Thank you, Alex, and thank you Dustin. One of my favorite things about a customer-led session like this is the impact on the business. So we talked about enabling organizations through improving governance and becoming more modern, and in the case of Lilly, it's a really meaningful outcome because that is enabling them, really indirectly, to help create better products for their customers, which is a very meaningful output. So we like to connect these technical things that we're talking about to real world, and that's a real meaningful one. So we do want to hit on three kind of technical takeaways again. Our goal here is always that somebody, you'll come away with something that either reinforces what you've done or inspires you to look into something else that can help you advance your operations and advance your organization.

[![Thumbnail 2320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2320)

[![Thumbnail 2340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2340)

So we'll touch on three takeaways. The first one is  being able to leverage this governance foundation to enable these organizational objectives. We didn't touch much on resilience today, but it ties in as well, but enabling agility and scale and moving faster is one of the core objectives here, and we hope you pick something up from this session that could drive that for your organization.  The next one is being able to simplify the governance operation through services like Account Factory for Terraform. Being able to leverage something that was built to drive automation and standardization is a way for you to simplify your operation and provide consistency and compliance.

[![Thumbnail 2370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/17c6b3b47d386f74/2370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3DF29pXJko&t=2370)

The third is managed, right? Being able to leverage  managed services, and in particular what Alex mentioned about managed controls, is super, super important. And I'll add to that that, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I'm constantly talking to customers and working with our service teams. We're always looking to add more to our controls library, right? The things that you need to drive consistency, compliance, meeting your cost, security, operational, and compliance standards. We continue to add to our repository of rules that again are managed for you behind the scenes.

So hopefully some of that resonated and you could take some things away and work on that following up with your account teams. We of course would love to talk to you afterward. We'll be kind of lingering around and happy to take some questions and connect with us afterward. And then last but not least, please make sure to go into the app and complete the survey. That's our request of you. We thank you so much for being here and spending the whole session with us, so enjoy the rest of re:Invent.
