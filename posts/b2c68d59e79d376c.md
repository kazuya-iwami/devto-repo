### Unifying Testing and Monitoring: Checkly's Approach to Modern Software Reliability

 All right, folks, almost revving it up here. I heard there are a couple more talks after me, but let's talk about reliability. Reliability is hard and it's rare. What we do, what I do is I'm Hannes Lenke.  I'm CEO and co-founder of Checkly, and we help you to detect, communicate, and resolve issues fast. I'm on a mission to help your engineers to own reliability from pull request to postmortem.

 Software, take a step back a decade ago, software was built yearly, shipped quarterly, then monthly, weekly, daily, and now we're almost there where agents can build the software, ship faster, almost instantly. That's cool. On the other side,  reliability is eroding. Reliability is still in 2013, and we've got to think about how to bring that into the modern age.

Why is that though? Yesterday, applications were very simple, right? You had one single team,  maybe one, two, three dependencies, a database. And when you released something and something went wrong, then you knew exactly what kind of service was responsible for it. That was yesterday. Now today,  applications are much more complex, right? They have dependencies, and every new dependency that you're introducing introduces potential failure risks to your reliability. And I'm not saying that's bad to be honest. You know, all these integrations, if it's payment providers, databases, et cetera, they allowed us to ship fast and they're still allowing us to ship fast because we don't need to build everything, right? But everything is kind of connected to each other, and reliability is left behind.

[![Thumbnail 160](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/b2c68d59e79d376c/160.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYJ_1xW4Sy4&t=160)

Now, the answer was for years more people, more processes, more tech.  You tested your application, you monitored your application, and we had different teams doing that, right? So there was a QA team doing these tests, developers building the application, and operations monitoring, being responsible for production. The funny thing though is, you know, both teams,  both processes try to answer a very similar, if not the same question. Does your application work from an end user perspective?

It's all about validating that your application works on staging, validating that it still works on production after a while, catching failures before your users actually see these failures on staging, and catching failures later on because, you know, one of the services that you depend on might have an issue or someone might change an API endpoint, et cetera. You want to verify your integrations and look at performance over time, right, a certain performance over time. These are a lot of things that you need to do, that we're used to doing, automated tasks during CI/CD. And later on, on production, we use manual testing, et cetera. Of course we try to automate as much as possible.

[![Thumbnail 270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/b2c68d59e79d376c/270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYJ_1xW4Sy4&t=270)

You know, throughout all of our customers that we have, we have  1,300 paying customers across the world. There are three principles that we are seeing that the high performing teams are pretty much adopting. One is predictability, really being able to predict how your app works when you release it to production and before you release it to production. Second is accountability, really knowing what changed, who changed it, why, when, and really knowing if a problem occurs where it comes from.

[![Thumbnail 330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/b2c68d59e79d376c/330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYJ_1xW4Sy4&t=330)

Where it occurs, where it comes from, and then that feeds into resiliency. You want to be able to really build a resilient application and worst case, roll your application back fast so that your users are not affected. So what Checkly does is we unify testing and monitoring  in one workflow. Your Playwright tests, your API tests, your uptime checks, your alerts, status pages, they all follow one workflow. They follow a workflow that is made for a software development life cycle, all version controlled, and it's built for speed.

[![Thumbnail 360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/b2c68d59e79d376c/360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYJ_1xW4Sy4&t=360)

[![Thumbnail 390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/b2c68d59e79d376c/390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYJ_1xW4Sy4&t=390)

So how do we do this? How do our customers do this? They build these checks, tests  in Playwright for UI automation, JavaScript TypeScript for API testing, and then uptime monitors, all as code. And then they deploy them over to our platform and we run them continuously across the world to let you know  about issues before your users face them. This was our mantra for the last decade, right? You build it, you run it, you own it. This is a mantra of the past. I don't think it keeps up until today.

Who's you in this case? Who is it?  Everyone who touches  the user experience of a customer is you in my mind. And touching the user experience of a customer nowadays is obviously someone who's responsible pretty much for the code, a developer, an engineer. And the reality though is it's now augmented with agents, it's cloud code and all the other tools. Who are you using today, agents to develop code? All right, some of  you. Tomorrow, I believe agents will be capable enough to build even more code, in the end ship code, monitor code, so it will become you build it, you test it, you monitor it, you own it. 

[![Thumbnail 500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/b2c68d59e79d376c/500.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYJ_1xW4Sy4&t=500)

That's what Checkly's made for. We give you tests that you can promote to monitors. You can define alerts, status pages, so really detect issues, communicate them, and in the end you get the assets that you need to resolve issues fast. To do one thing,  it's pretty much integrating your monitoring stack into the CI/CD stack. So your CI/CD pipeline that you have today, maybe with end-to-end tests, speaks the same language as your reliability pipeline. You speak in your organization the same language. All teams use the same frameworks, use the tests that are already built during the software development for monitoring. They look at the same assets when something fails, really know if something goes wrong.

[![Thumbnail 570](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/b2c68d59e79d376c/570.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYJ_1xW4Sy4&t=570)

That speeds you up. Also enables you to speak pretty much that language from your local development towards production. All right, that was my talk. If you want to talk about how to bring reliability and monitoring into the modern age, then visit us at our booth. It's 1856. It's over there.  Thank you.
