### The Unique Challenges of Cloud Vulnerability Management and Tenable's Expertise

 Hi everyone. Excited to be here. Thank you all for coming to our session about vulnerability management in the cloud. My name is Amos. I'm a product manager for Tenable, and before I start, I want to know my crowd a bit. Which one of you by a show of hands is familiar with Tenable? And Tenable VM? And Tenable Cloud Security? Cool.

[![Thumbnail 50](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/50.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=50)

[![Thumbnail 70](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/70.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=70)

[![Thumbnail 80](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/80.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=80)

 So let's start. What are we going to talk about today? We'll start by speaking about the challenges and the different complexities of vulnerability management in the cloud and why it's different from doing the same on-premises.  We'll talk about Tenable and specifically Tenable Cloud Security and why I believe we are a great partner for you to have for the vulnerability management program in the cloud. And also about our brand new, I think two weeks old,  cloud VM offering that is really unique and can solve a lot of your problems. And obviously we'll see it in action with a live demo.

[![Thumbnail 90](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/90.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=90)

[![Thumbnail 120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=120)

 So there are many challenges for vulnerability management, but right now we'll focus on the cloud and why it's different than the standard challenges of VM. The cloud has unique workloads with unique workload lifecycles, especially containers. They are stored in their images are stored in container repositories. They are spun up, taken down. They're very ephemeral. They change all the time, which creates challenges of visibility.  It's hard to know what's going on. And these visibility challenges make it really, really hard to operationalize agent-based solutions. It's hard to deploy everything, it's hard to manage everything, to create decent coverage, so these solutions basically don't really work in the cloud.

[![Thumbnail 130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/130.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=130)

[![Thumbnail 160](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/160.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=160)

 On top of that, cloud environments are very complex. They have tons of different resources, tons of different services. Each one has its own configuration, which creates a very non-trivial context for the vulnerabilities, and you must know the context to prioritize the vulnerabilities as well.  So you have the challenges for the cloud, but it becomes even more complex when you combine it with managing vulnerabilities on-premises. It's hard to have one solution to answer both all of these challenges and the on-premises challenges. So most solutions only do one of them, so it's hard to solve both.

[![Thumbnail 180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=180)

[![Thumbnail 190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=190)

[![Thumbnail 210](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/210.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=210)

[![Thumbnail 220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=220)

 So we have challenges. Why do I believe we're a great vendor to solve these challenges?  So Tenable is a leader for over two decades in the vulnerability management domain, and why is that? We have a really, really good vulnerability intelligence which helps you prioritize what vulnerabilities you need to solve first.  CVSS isn't really good at doing that. Sixty percent of CVEs have CVSS that is high or critical,  so basically you can't prioritize based on CVSS. And with Tenable's Vulnerability Priority Rating, our proprietary scoring for CVEs, it's more than an order of magnitude lower than that, so it's really easy to know what you should do first, where to focus.

[![Thumbnail 270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=270)

[![Thumbnail 290](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/290.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=290)

And you might ask yourself, alright, what are you doing there? How do you prioritize? So we take many different risk factors including knowing what real threat actors do and where, and we push all of these factors into our proprietary machine learning engine and it creates a new scoring which is much, much more accurate. On top of helping you prioritize, we also help you remediate efficiently with our plugin IDs.  What's a plugin? A plugin is a grouping of CVEs where we tell you that with a single action, what's an action, like a software update or a patch, you can solve multiple CVEs. So if we tell you that if you operate this version, you only solve one CVE, but if you do this, you solve twenty with a single action, you obviously want to start with solving twenty CVEs at a time and it helps you create a  more efficient remediation program.

[![Thumbnail 300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=300)

 So for over two decades we did great vulnerability management, but in the recent years Tenable also became a very important player in the cloud security market and the exposure management market.

[![Thumbnail 320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=320)

### Tenable Cloud Security and the New Cloud VM Offering: Agentless Solutions for Container and VM Workloads

So let's talk a bit about our cloud security solution, just one second.  Tenable Cloud Security connects to your cloud environment or cloud environments, even multi-cloud environments, and basically reads everything to help you create an inventory of what you have there and where your risk lies. We look at everything from IAM configuration, data and data assets, and obviously vulnerabilities, and create a unified view of the risk and the different context for everything and why you should care even if you care mostly about vulnerabilities.

[![Thumbnail 360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=360)

 We can take a look at this. You can see the toxic combinations over there with the red rectangle where you can see that we don't only show you vulnerabilities, we show you the context. We take everything we learn from the cloud as a context for vulnerabilities. If you read the first one, we tell you that you have critical vulnerabilities, but these vulnerabilities are also on workloads that face the public internet and they also have high privileges. So these are the vulnerabilities you want to solve first. Obviously they are much more important than vulnerabilities and assets that don't see the internet at all.

[![Thumbnail 410](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/410.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=410)

Once you know all of your cloud risk, you want to push it into our Exposure Management platform, Tenable One, recently selected by Gartner and Forrester as the number one leader in exposure management.  And what's exposure management? You have many, many different tools I assume that collect and analyze risks in different places of your environment, cloud, on-premises, OT, whatever, and you want to have a centralized single pane of glass to see all the risks. And this is Tenable One. We normalize the information and create a unified risk view. So we'll see it in action a bit later.

[![Thumbnail 450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/450.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=450)

And now I'm really, really happy to talk about our new offering. As I said, it's  only two weeks old, Cloud VM. Why did we build this offering? So we talked to many VM professionals and they told us, alright, we understand what you're doing in the cloud. Your Tenable Cloud Security platform is great. We see it provides a lot of interesting insights, but we want to start more focused on vulnerability management. So we may get there a bit later, but we want a more lightweight solution that only solves these specific problems, and we listened and we did it. So Cloud VM is a lightweight solution focusing on vulnerability management in the cloud.

[![Thumbnail 490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=490)

[![Thumbnail 510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=510)

[![Thumbnail 530](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/530.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=530)

 What use cases are we trying to solve? So first of all, you have assets in the cloud, you want to know what vulnerabilities they have. We do it relying on the same vulnerability database that we talked about before.  We can support migration from on-premises to cloud because during this process, it can be challenging to have a continuous view of what's the current state of your risk, and with this offering you can do it. And once you have a hybrid environment,  you want to have a single pane of glass to see all your risk of everything from your on-premises environment and in the cloud with a unified view. So all these use cases are supported here.

[![Thumbnail 550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=550)

[![Thumbnail 570](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/570.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=570)

And now, let's dive into the offering and what we're doing there. So  in the cloud, there are two major types of workloads, VMs and containers. VMs are more standard, more similar to on-premises, so we'll focus on containers that are more unique to the cloud. Containers have a unique life cycle.  They start as a Dockerfile in your code repository, then you build the image and push it into a test container registry. You test it, and then when everything is good, you push it to your production registry and into production.

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=600)

We believe that you need to analyze the risk and to surface it as early as possible. You don't need to wait until runtime. You need to do it as shift-left as  possible because it's easier to fix.

[![Thumbnail 630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=630)

Our solution analyzes risk from the test registries all the way to runtime, because you always want to check all the way to the right since this is what's actually running. Maybe you missed something when you scanned the registries, and you want to see what's going on in there. So let's dive another step inside. We do all of it agentlessly.  As I said, the agent in the cloud is problematic and hard to deploy, so we scan without an agent. You just connect us to a cloud environment, and it's very quick. It takes minutes, and we scan the workloads, both VMs and containers.

[![Thumbnail 670](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/670.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=670)

[![Thumbnail 680](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/680.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=680)

We create a comprehensive software inventory, and from the inventory with the vulnerability database, we create a list of all the CVEs that you have in your environment. On top of doing the runtime analysis, we connect to your image registries, the container image registries, and we analyze them. So with the cloud connector,  we can scan ECR repositories, but we don't stop there. We can also connect to third-party repositories.  We can connect there, provide the relevant permissions, and we can read the images from there, but also correlate them to what we found on runtime, so it's not separate.

[![Thumbnail 700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=700)

[![Thumbnail 720](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=720)

[![Thumbnail 730](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/730.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=730)

### Live Demo: From Container Registries to Tenable One Exposure Management Platform

Once we have all of the information from all the vulnerabilities that we found in the repositories and in runtime, we combine it also  with our Exposure Management platform to combine it with the vulnerability findings from other places in your organization, not just the cloud. We'll see it again in a demo right about now.  Now let's see it in action, and I'll apologize in advance. The video controls are a bit challenging, so I hope it goes smoothly, but if not, bear  with me.

[![Thumbnail 770](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/770.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=770)

[![Thumbnail 780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=780)

[![Thumbnail 790](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/790.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=790)

Here you can see the dashboard. You can see the different trends. You have here how many vulnerabilities you have in your environment. You can see the MTTR analysis based on the severity, and you can see different aggregations on the bottom by different factors of the vulnerabilities we found in your environment.  You can see the inventory here. We'll first focus on the container repositories. You can see here  the list of many, many different repositories we're connected to. Let's click one of the images  and see the findings we found on the image.

[![Thumbnail 800](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/800.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=800)

[![Thumbnail 820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=820)

[![Thumbnail 830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=830)

We'll start with vulnerability findings. You click here and you see a full list of what we found  on this image, all the vulnerabilities, a lot of information about it. We don't stop with vulnerabilities. We also scan for malicious files we found there on the image. Here you can see, for example, Metasploit files that have no business being on production images, and we found them on this container.  Now after we saw findings on container images, we can see findings on actual workloads found on runtime. 

[![Thumbnail 840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=840)

[![Thumbnail 850](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/850.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=850)

[![Thumbnail 860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=860)

Here we'll look at VMs with vulnerabilities in them. You can see we found many resources. We'll choose one of them that has vulnerabilities,  and you can see an overview of what we found there on this workload. Here again, a full list of vulnerabilities on this runtime workload and the  full software inventory, whether vulnerable or not vulnerable. If you find malicious files, you can also see them there. Another very important view is a full  view of all the vulnerabilities we find in your environment.

[![Thumbnail 870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=870)

[![Thumbnail 880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=880)

[![Thumbnail 900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=900)

You can filter them, for example, by a specific account and by severity, so you can focus on the things that you really want to solve first,  high and critical vulnerabilities. Not only that, for example, let's take the case where your  CIO called you and told you, my friend told me there's this new attack, a new vulnerability. It's called ZeroLogon. Are we impacted? You can go here, look for the new threat by name, ZeroLogon, and you see  where we found it in your environment.

[![Thumbnail 910](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/910.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=910)

[![Thumbnail 920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=920)

[![Thumbnail 940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=940)

Here you can see the different scores, both VPR and CVSS.  Here you can see the different risk factors we take into account when calculating the VPR.  At the bottom you see the real world events, the different things attackers did that also impact the severity and the trend over time. The VPR can be reduced and then increased according to the real world events that we found. You can also view it as a timeline, and if you click it, you get more  information about the event that we're talking about.

[![Thumbnail 950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=950)

[![Thumbnail 960](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/960.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=960)

[![Thumbnail 970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=970)

On top of that, you can also search by CVE  and see the information about the specific CVE.  You can see the impact it has on your environment, where you found this CVE. You can see the full list of all VMs impacted by this vulnerability,  and also all container images and also software packages that have this vulnerability in runtime.

[![Thumbnail 1000](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/1000.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=1000)

[![Thumbnail 1010](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/45fdaec2f606f25f/1010.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVKXpsX4AIA&t=1010)

Now we're moving to Tenable One, our exposure management platform. Here you see a unified view of the exposure and the risk you have across all of your environment, not just cloud. You can see also OT, web application scanning, whatever sources you have for risk and vulnerabilities. But you can also look at it  per exposure type, per category, per source. You have also a unified inventory of all of your assets, and  what's really cool here is that you have the AES, the Asset Exposure Score, that normalizes the risk for all your assets into one prioritized list, which is really non-trivial because usually you must go to different tools and see they say this is important, they say that is important. How do I know what's most important? Here you look at this with this score.

Once you have this unified score for everything, you can create  programs that take into account risks from different places. So let's look at cloud migration that we mentioned before. We can tag  some resources as related to migration, some from the still on-premises, some already in the cloud, and they are tagged. Once they are tagged, you can create a card that lets you monitor this program, this project. Here you have an overview. You can see the custom dashboard,  the custom view we created for this project, for these tags, and you get many metrics that give you very deep visibility on the  current risk and the trends over time, and whether it's still on-premises or is it mostly the ones that already moved to the cloud.  You can see a dashboard that you can really customize to show whatever you want, to follow different metrics you really care about.

Cool. So this is the demo, and before leaving, let's focus on the things that I really want you to remember once you leave this meeting. So I talked a lot. These are the most important things. Yes, if you haven't already, you really should do vulnerability management in the cloud because it has vulnerabilities. You should get a hold of them and see what's important, what's less important. When you do it, it's really better if you do it with  a unified program for VM on-premises and in the cloud. And to do it, it's better to do it with a vendor that has really deep expertise both in vulnerability management and in the cloud, and I think we are such a vendor.

 Remember that we have a brand new offering for vulnerability management in the cloud that is lightweight, that is a first step into the cloud. And if you want to hear more about this or anything Tenable, feel free to come to our booth, 251. It's just over there. So I'll be there and other people will  be there, and we'll be happy to answer any of your questions. I'll also be around here if you want to ask anything now. So thank you very much.
