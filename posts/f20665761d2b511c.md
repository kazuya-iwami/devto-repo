### Introducing Amazon Quick Suite and Quick Research: Compressing Days of Work into Minutes

 Hi, everybody. My name is Jon Einkauf. I'm a principal product manager at AWS. In October, Amazon announced a new offering called Amazon Quick Suite that is designed to unify your data and applications so that business users can quickly  get the information that they're looking for and take action with the help of agentic AI teammates. I'm going to give you a quick overview of  Quick Suite. There are a number of key capabilities here. If we look on the top row, I'm going to highlight a few of these. Spaces is a feature that allows you to organize your files, your data, and dashboards into a knowledge base that you can share with users and groups within your organization. Chat agents allow you to create a custom AI assistant that has access to certain knowledge bases and actions. This is something that you can also share with other users and groups.

[![Thumbnail 100](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/f20665761d2b511c/100.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_BUW-Ys0Hs&t=100)

Research is the part of Quick Suite that I work on. This is a deep research tool that works across your company data and external data. We will talk about that a little bit more on the next slide. QuickSight is a tool for visualizing your data and creating and sharing dashboards. Quick Flows is a feature that allows you to automate certain repetitive tasks that you might have, such as preparing for meetings and creating to-do lists. Automate is a solution for automation of complex business processes. So what is Quick Research? Quick Research is the deep research component of Quick Suite.  It allows business users to tackle complex and time-intensive research and analysis. Think about creating a market research plan, creating a product roadmap, doing analysis of your competitors, or creating a pricing strategy—things that ordinarily take a lot of time to research, synthesize data sources, and create recommendations and plans.

In the video here  you'll see a really quick end-to-end demo of what it looks like. So here, if I wanted to do research, I click on new research. I enter my research goal. I select the sources that I want the agent  to use. I then see a list of the topics that the agent is going to research and explore. If you look on the right, you can see some recommendations that the agent is making.  Research kicks off and takes about twenty minutes. At the end of that time, you have a detailed report. You can go through the report and pick a  statement to go deeper on. You can view sources. You can also, if you want to create an executive summary of the research, download it and share it with other users. So what we're trying to do here is take something that would normally take days or weeks and compress it down into twenty minutes.

### FactSet Integration: Bringing Industry-Leading Financial Data to Quick Research

Quick Research recently became much more powerful with the integration of FactSet. To tell us more about that, I'm joined by Calvin Ho, who is VP of Partnerships at FactSet, and thank you very much for your attention. We're going to be learning a little bit more about how FactSet can be brought into the data to empower researchers to do even deeper research and access even better and deeper data. Thanks, John. I'm very excited to be here today and teach you a little bit about the integration with Quick Research. My name is Calvin Ho. I work at FactSet and I help manage our strategic partnership with AWS.  For those of you who are not familiar with FactSet, we are a global financial data and analytics company. We have roughly 240,000 users of our FactSet workstation, which is our SaaS front-end application. We also have a large number of users who consume our data via data feeds and APIs. We have roughly 9,000 global clients and over 12,000 employees, and we are a trusted partner to the world's largest financial institutions.

[![Thumbnail 250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/f20665761d2b511c/250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_BUW-Ys0Hs&t=250)

 I know many of you here are builders, and as you know, the solutions that you build are only as good as the data that powers them. The facts that we're very proud to say is that we have a lot of industry-leading content that our clients use to help fuel their generative AI applications. These are some of the data sets that I'll cover today, and I just want to let you know that everything here is available in the Amazon Data Exchange on the AWS Marketplace, natively available in S3 or in Redshift. So the first two columns have the core structured and unstructured content. That's our basic fundamental data and foundational data that our clients use for workflows such as fundamental analysis or quant research. Moving on to market and macroeconomic data, for real-time exchanges, we stream over 300 global exchanges and OTCs. All of that data streaming is available natively in AWS through the AWS data platform.

For event-driven data, we have mergers and acquisition data, private equity, and venture capital data as well. We are also very strong in alternative data. The two data sets I'll highlight are supply chain data, which gives you an understanding of the complex network of a company's competitors, partners, and suppliers. We also have geographic and industry revenue data, which helps you understand a company's revenue exposure by country, which is particularly helpful given the geopolitical risks these days.

I've bolded five data sets under core structured and unstructured content, and these are the five content sets that are available via Quick Research today. We have pricing and reference data, which includes end-of-day pricing, corporate actions, shares outstanding, and dividend information. Fundamentals include your company financial statements and ratios. Estimates include financial earnings estimates along with buy, sell, and hold ratings. For unstructured content, we have news from our Street Account news service, which is a curated news service where we focus on market-moving news like company press releases and economic data. Under transcripts, we have company event data, which could be company earnings call transcripts or any sort of event that a company might hold.

### Live Demonstration: Analyzing NVIDIA with FactSet-Powered Quick Research

Let's jump over to Quick Research right now. Let's say I'm a financial analyst and I would like to ask about NVIDIA, everyone's favorite GPU producer. I'm going to ask Quick Research to create a report for me. I'm going to say analyze NVIDIA, including how it has performed year to date versus its peers. Summarize its latest earnings call, summarize the last two weeks of news associated with NVIDIA, and identify two or three key risks. That's a very complicated question, right? I'm going to select facts and data over on the bottom left, and then I'm going to  start researching. As you can see, the report came back right away. I'm just kidding, it's a snapshot, but you get the idea. What we have here is a 12-page report that gets generated. It is very thorough and very detailed, and a few things I'll highlight here. All the figures you can see are referenceable, so if there's a financial figure like we have in the second paragraph, you can see I highlighted the source, and it's from FactSet. You don't have to worry about hallucinations. You can just go straight to the source to look at the article or look at the data.

[![Thumbnail 480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/f20665761d2b511c/480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_BUW-Ys0Hs&t=480)



[![Thumbnail 510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/f20665761d2b511c/510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_BUW-Ys0Hs&t=510)

I asked a few things, and I won't go over the whole report, but I asked about year-to-date stock performance versus peers. Quick Research was able to go to FactSet, pull in stock performance data, and identify peers as well. Now you can see what Qualcomm, AMD, and Intel have done year to date versus NVIDIA. Another item that I asked is I asked it to identify risk factors.  Quick Research went and identified three risk factors. One is NVIDIA's reliance on Taiwan semiconductors. The second is the US-China export controls. Number three is competitive pressures from AMD and others. I hope this gives you an idea of how powerful Quick Research is with facts and content. A report like this would have probably taken an analyst two or three days to build, so you get this in roughly twenty minutes, which is fantastic.

I also know many of you here probably don't work for a financial services firm, but we actually sell a lot of this content to corporations as well. A lot of our clients use it for things like competitive intelligence and industry benchmarking. If you're a company in any industry and you want to know how well you're doing against your peers, you can look at your financials versus a peer's financials. You can analyze earnings calls from your peers and see if there are any general themes going on. It's a really powerful tool. If any of you are FactSet clients and you're interested, feel free to reach out to me. On the Quick Research page, there is information on how to reach out to your FactSet representative as well. I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you for coming.
