### Opening Remarks: Peter DeSantis Takes the Stage at re:Invent 2025

Please welcome the senior vice president of Utility Computing at AWS, Peter DeSantis.   Good morning. Welcome to the penultimate day of re:Invent 2025. Thank you all for your participation this week. It's been a great week, and I hope you  had as much fun as we did. I expect many of you probably came this morning expecting to see Werner. I get it—we switched things up. You've been busy all week, so I came prepared for this. If you just direct your attention to the screens at the side, hopefully this feels a little more familiar.

For those of you that don't know me, I usually do the Monday night keynote. I asked about beer, but apparently you can't do beer at a morning keynote. That makes sense, but I apologize. I'm more interesting after a couple  beers. If my transition didn't help you get a fix, you can catch the real Werner this afternoon at the closing  keynote. As he says, they'll be the last thing standing between you and the party.  I'm not going to spoil anything, but Werner tells me he's going to talk about what this AI transformation is going to mean for developers. That got me thinking: what is this AI transformation going to mean for the cloud?

I think it's pretty obvious. This new generation of AI-driven applications is going to drive a ton of innovation in infrastructure, and that's exciting for us.  But I want to start out talking about what's probably not going to change. These are the things that we've been focused on delivering since the first days of AWS, the things that we really care about. I would argue these things are maybe even more important. These are the core attributes of the AWS Cloud, and delivering on these  attributes has guided every service, every API, and every technical decision that we've made and continue to make.  We think about these things a lot, and we make big, deep, long-term investments to support these attributes.

### Core Attributes of AWS Cloud: Security, Availability, Elasticity, Cost, and Agility

Take security.  As you probably already know, it's not just the good guys that are getting more productive with AI. The bad guys are using the same tools to attack your products, your customers, and your infrastructure. So it's never been a more important time to know that your cloud provider's first priority is security.  Right there behind security is availability. The sheer size and scale of the applications being built right now demand performance from security, databases, analytics, and networks. So there's never been a better time to build on a cloud that's been tested running the most demanding  workloads of the last decade.

[![Thumbnail 250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=250)

What about elasticity? One of the most important things about the cloud is that it takes away capacity planning. It wasn't long ago that one of the first things startups would need to do is plan and provision their infrastructure. What a complete waste of time. And worse yet, there's no right answer to the question: how much capacity do I need? If you plan too little, you miss your big moment. If you plan too much, you might not be able to afford to get to your big moment.  Today, capacity planning is likely something that you don't do at all, and that's a great thing. AWS is ready to scale when you need us, but we're not done here.

[![Thumbnail 270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=270)

AI workloads have led to an unprecedented increase in demand over the last few years, and we see this  as an opportunity to take the innovations that we've been working on for the last couple of decades and apply them to these new technologies. Our goal is to give you the same elasticity that you get from a service such as S3 with your AI workloads, and you're going to hear a little bit more about how we're doing that this morning. And that brings us to cost. The promise of AI is exciting, and it will transform every aspect of our life. But one thing that anyone who's put an AI application into production knows is that AI isn't cheap. It's really, really expensive to build these highly capable models, and more expensive still to run the massive amount of inference that we need to transform our lives with these models. You see almost daily headlines of the tens of billions of dollars that are being invested in data centers, power, and capacity to support this AI transformation. AWS is investing massively in this expansion as well.

[![Thumbnail 310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=310)

[![Thumbnail 330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=330)

 We're doing something else. We're investing deeply in lowering the cost of building these models and running these workloads. You've heard a little bit about Trainium this week, but later this morning, we'll share more about how we're building Trainium to meaningfully lower the cost of  these workloads.

That leaves us with Agility. When we launched AWS almost 20 years ago, I think the attribute that most contributed to the success of the cloud was Agility. It became quickly apparent that the companies who adopted the cloud were able to move faster than the companies that stayed on-premises. They were able to innovate faster. They were able to deliver value to their customers faster. They were able to grow faster with fewer issues. And most importantly, they were able to pivot faster. That's Agility. That's the magic of the cloud. You can launch, optimize, and pivot quickly.

[![Thumbnail 410](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/410.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=410)

[![Thumbnail 420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=420)

Now, doesn't that sound exactly like what you're going to need during this AI transformation? There are many ways that AWS helps you be more agile, but one of the ways is by making  sure that you have the right tool for the job. Whether you're a startup inventing something new or an enterprise modernizing old systems, we give you the building blocks to  create anything that you can imagine. This breadth and depth approach  isn't an accident. It's a deliberate  choice that we make year after year to keep investing in new services and new capabilities and new ways for you to build.  Because we believe that when we remove constraints, when we give you every possible building block, that's when the real magic happens. That's when you can stop asking, can I  build this and start asking, what shall I build next?

[![Thumbnail 440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=440)

The really exciting thing is the power of these building blocks is only going to be magnified through Agentic development. So the things that matter in the world of AI are the exact same things that we've been obsessing over for  the last 20 years. But these capabilities don't happen by accident. You don't just wake up one day and say, I want better security or lower cost. These attributes come from a very deep commitment and investment over time.

### The Nitro System: Eliminating Virtualization Jitter Through Custom Silicon

Let me give you my favorite example. I'll set the stage. It's 2010, a few years after we launched EC2. By this time, it was abundantly clear that customers loved EC2 and they wanted to  run all sorts of workloads on it. And for the most part, they could do it. Our performance was just fine. But for a few of  the most demanding workloads, we faced a challenge. While our systems delivered great performance, most of the time  we'd see these frustrating outlier latencies, or something we call jitter, where performance would suddenly drop off just a few hundred microseconds, but enough to impact these applications. These excursions came from the virtualization layer.

[![Thumbnail 520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=520)

[![Thumbnail 540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=540)

Now, virtualization was one of the key enablers of EC2, and it works really well. But common wisdom at the time was that virtualization would work fine for less demanding workloads, but it  could simply never deliver the performance of a bare metal server. But that wasn't compatible with our vision for EC2, where we wanted to run every workload. So we got really focused on fixing the jitter problem. Basically, we  aimed to put jitter where it belonged. Week after week, our engineers would deep dive into the data and tackle these outlier latencies. We made impressive progress with optimizations and achieved results that many people didn't think we could.

[![Thumbnail 560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/560.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=560)

[![Thumbnail 590](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/590.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=590)

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=600)

But eventually it became clear  we didn't have a path to bare metal performance. There was just always going to be some virtualization tax. So of course you have to change what's possible. And that's where the Nitro system came in. Nitro is our AWS-designed custom silicon. It moves virtualization off the server and onto dedicated hardware, and this allowed us to completely eliminate the jitter problem and actually get exactly the same performance, in fact better performance than bare  metal. Nitro also improves security, delivers higher performance, and allows us to support a wide range of instance types. The Nitro system is an excellent example  of the deep investments that we've made, in this case actually building our own chips to enable these key product capabilities.

[![Thumbnail 640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/640.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=640)

[![Thumbnail 660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/660.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=660)

Now, for those of you that have joined me on Monday night, you're probably thinking I'm about to get into a deep computer science lesson on how Nitro works, but I have something better this morning. This is one of my favorite textbooks from my undergraduate degree. It's an excellent book and an undeniable part of the computer science canon written by a couple of luminaries in our field. This is an image of my actual textbook from undergrad, which  I still have. This is the second edition, and it turns out that's a bit dated at this point. The industry has changed a lot. In fact, the seventh edition of this textbook just recently came out, and this edition actually has a section that covers the Nitro system. How cool is that? You can now  actually learn about Nitro and Graviton in this computer science textbook.

[![Thumbnail 700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=700)

To celebrate, we're going to give away some copies of this book this morning. I'm going to put a QR code up on the screen in a second. If you scan it, you can get a copy of this book. The first 1,000 people here in the room can take this book home if you're lucky enough to snag a copy. You'll be able to pick it up at the expo hall after the keynote. But really, even if you didn't get a copy, everyone, including our friends online, have one today because you didn't need to sit through my  computer science lesson.

[![Thumbnail 710](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/710.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=710)

Nitro is a great example of the deep investments we've been making for the past 20 years. It's  also the reason that AWS started building our own chips, which now include Graviton, our custom AWS server processor, and Trainium, our AI chip. So to start off this morning, we'd like to tell you more about Graviton. And to do that,  please welcome to the stage Dave Brown. 

[![Thumbnail 760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=760)

### Graviton's Evolution: Building Cloud-Native Processors from the Ground Up

Well, as Peter mentioned earlier, Nitro changed what people thought was possible in the cloud. It showed that if you could control the silicon, the hardware, and the system architecture, you could get performance and efficiency gains that were simply not available using commodity hardware. And as we spent more time with ARM inside the Nitro  system, a natural question emerged. If custom silicon could improve network and storage so meaningfully, why couldn't we apply that to compute?

[![Thumbnail 790](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/790.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=790)

We took a step back and asked, what if a server processor, what would it look like if we designed it specifically for cloud workloads? Not adapted, not repurposed, but built for the cloud from the ground up. And that's where the Graviton processor came from—a brand new design based on delivering the best price performance for workloads that customers run every day in the cloud and across industries.  Organizations are getting better performance and lower cost with Graviton.  Adobe is cutting emissions by 37 percent.  Epic Games is powering massive, low-latency global gaming workloads, and Formula 1, one of my favorite sports, is running simulations at 40 percent faster.  Pinterest is lowering costs by 47 percent, and SAP has seen a 35 percent performance improvement with their SAP HANA Cloud.

These aren't just demos. These are production systems running faster, cleaner, and cheaper with Graviton. And we've seen the same enthusiasm from our software partners. They're tuning compilers, reworking runtimes, optimizing libraries, and building native support across their platforms for Graviton.  They're leaning in because they see clear performance benefits, cost benefits, and a strong long-term architecture.  Industry collaboration around Graviton continues to grow and mature.

Now, delivering the best price performance in EC2 takes attention at every layer.  It starts with building great performance into our silicon, but it also comes from how we build and operate the systems around that silicon. Because we  designed both the processor and the servers, we can optimize across the full stack, and that includes something customers don't often think about: cooling. This is the traditional cooling approach that most processors use. You have the silicon and  then a thermal interface material, or TIM, and then a protective lid, and then more TIM, and then the heatsink. Now it's reliable and easy to manufacture, and it's been the standard approach for a long time. However, the physics behind thermal management is fascinating.

[![Thumbnail 920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=920)

[![Thumbnail 940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=940)

 Heat transfer is straightforward physics. Every layer in the thermal path slows heat movement, so more resistance leads to higher junction temperatures. Higher temperatures increase leakage, and higher leakage increases power consumption.  This is an area where inefficiency can stack up very quickly.

[![Thumbnail 960](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/960.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=960)

Traditional CPUs use this design because they must support many systems, many form factors, and many cooling solutions. The lid provides a stable interface. Since we control the entire system for Graviton, we had the opportunity to think differently.  Instead of following the traditional model, we designed a direct-to-silicon cooling solution. We removed the lid along with a layer of TIM, which reduced the resistance and allows heat to move more efficiently. This requires precision manufacturing and carefully selected materials, but the result is meaningful. Our fan power drops by 33 percent, and we are only able to do this because we control the entire stack.

Improving system efficiency is just one part of delivering great  performance. The silicon itself has to keep getting better generation after generation, and chip development is both  iterative and long term. Each generation of Graviton expands the set of workloads that we can serve. Every time a new set of workloads comes along, we learn where the next set of bottlenecks are, and that learning feeds directly into the next generation.  It is a continuous improvement cycle. Each Graviton processor builds on what came before it and continues to push the architecture forward.

### Introducing Graviton5: 192 Cores with Five Times More L3 Cache

Last year I talked about optimizing Graviton for real-world  application performance. With Graviton3, we saw that L2 cache misses were having a notable impact on real-world workload performance. The cache is one of the most important predictors of CPU performance, so it became a real priority area for us. When a core needs data, it checks the  cache first. Cache is small and extremely fast, and it is designed to hold frequently accessed data. When that data is not available in the cache, the processor must go all the way out to main memory, which is much slower.

[![Thumbnail 1080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1080)

[![Thumbnail 1100](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1100.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1100)

Modern CPU architectures use a three-level cache hierarchy: L1,  L2, and L3. L1 is the fastest, L2 is larger but slightly slower, and L3 is larger still and shared among the cores. Missing all three levels of cache means you have to go to DRAM, which can take up to 100 nanoseconds.  That is a long time in CPU cycles, and this is why we love big caches. The more data you can keep close to the core, the fewer slow memory trips you have to take.

[![Thumbnail 1120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1120)

With Graviton4, we doubled the size of the L2 cache from 1 MB to 2 MB per core,  and that was one of the contributors that led to Graviton4 delivering up to 30 percent better performance than Graviton3. Doubling the L2 cache  significantly reduced L2 cache misses. However, designing a CPU is always about tradeoffs. In Graviton4, we also increased the core count by 50 percent and the L3 cache by about 12 percent.  That was the right balance for the scale-up workloads that we wanted to serve at the time. But with more cores sharing the relatively smaller increase in L3 cache, each core ended up with less L3 cache than before, which is why we saw an increase in L3 cache misses. These are the kinds of tradeoffs that you are constantly evaluating when designing silicon.

We also made a major architectural change by adding a coherent link between two  CPUs. This allowed us to deliver up to 192 vCPUs for databases and large analytical workloads. However, linking processors introduces new latency paths.  When a core needs to access memory on the other CPU, the request has to move across that interconnect, which adds latency, extra protocol overhead, and sometimes even queuing.  In certain scenarios, it can take up to three times longer.

We asked whether we could deliver 192 cores with uniform fast access to memory and more cache, all in a single package. Today we're excited to introduce Graviton5. The Graviton5 delivers 192 cores in one package and provides over five times the L3 cache of previous generations. Each core now gets up to 2.6 times more L3 cache,  which leads to better overall performance and better consistency. All of this comes together in our preview  of M9g instances, powered by Graviton5. M9g delivers up to 25% better performance than M8g and offers the best price performance in EC2 today.

We're already seeing incredible results from some of our early customers. Airbnb has seen up to 25% better performance. Atlassian has seen 20% lower latency. Honeycomb.io has seen 36% better performance per core, and SAP has seen an incredible 60% better performance on their OLTP queries for SAP HANA in the cloud.  These are significant real-world improvements and represent a major generational step forward. Now I'd like to bring up a guest who has been influential in shaping how developers build on AWS. Please join me in welcoming the Vice President of Cloud Systems and Platforms at Apple, Payam Mirrashidi.

### Apple's Journey with Swift and Graviton: 40% Performance Gains and 30% Cost Reduction

Thanks, Dave. Hi, I'm Payam Mirrashidi at Apple. We're driven by the idea that the  products and services we create should help people unleash their creativity and potential. We build some of the largest  internet services on the planet, and many of them run on AWS. My team works on services such as App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV, and podcasts.  The services have billions of users every day, and what I like to call the fun stuff. We also build the underlying cloud infrastructure across AWS and  our own data centers that makes it all possible.

[![Thumbnail 1390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1390)

That's a lot of technology power on one slide, and not just the kind you see in the F1 movie, but the kind that powers experiences for billions of users all over the world. That's why we're always looking for ways to optimize how we develop and deliver our services. Many of you are navigating a hybrid world, balancing your own infrastructure with the power of AWS. At Apple, we get that. We face the same pressures and challenges you do. 

[![Thumbnail 1400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1400)

We're in a massive operation tackling the same problems: scalability, performance, and reliability. We're solving it with AWS. Like many of you, my journey as  a developer started with coding in C, and then in 2002, when I joined Apple as an engineer on the original iTunes Store, we were a Java shop.  We were a small team with big dreams that had to change how the world consumed music. Over the years, we mostly stuck with Java, and when we needed more performance, we used C++. But it was cumbersome to develop and even more difficult to support at scale in production.

[![Thumbnail 1440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1440)

[![Thumbnail 1470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1470)

As our services scaled, we also faced new coding challenges. The tools we had were not always up to the task. Around the same time, Apple's own operating system team was creating Swift,  initially the premier language for developing the apps you know and love on your iPhones and Macs. Swift's performance, modern design, and built-in safety features revealed this potential for server-side development.  Now I know introducing a new language, especially on the server, can raise eyebrows, but with Swift, a single developer can often handle both client and server side. You can turn client-side logic into a library, run it server-side, maintaining a single code base.

[![Thumbnail 1490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1490)

The power of having the same logic on both client and server is immense, and I think you'll find it incredibly valuable for your teams. Today, Apple uses Swift to power everything from Apple Silicon all the way up to  the pixels rendered on your screen. It's easy to learn, scales beautifully from embedded systems to massive architectures, and is perfect for building distributed  services or complex system software. Apple is processing billions of requests per day with apps built in Swift.

Running directly on AWS Graviton , we've seen a 40% increase in performance and a 30% reduction in cost by rewriting core services in Swift and moving workloads to  Graviton. The transition from x86 has been seamless, with a near drop-in replacement for Java thanks to Graviton. Apple  moved to ARM more than a decade ago to power our devices, and now we're seeing the same value moving to ARM-based Graviton. To get more out of our infrastructure, higher throughput means fewer instances, lower costs, and a smaller footprint. A win for our customers and for the  planet.

A great example is our spam detection feature in iOS 16.  We use Swift on Graviton to scale the compute-heavy operations behind the service that helps us detect suspicious phone numbers while maintaining privacy for hundreds of millions of users. In fact, the Messages app running on your phone and the spam detection feature running on the server are using the same language and scaling seamlessly. This  feature is built with homomorphic encryption using a Swift library that we open-sourced, enabling private and secure computation of data without the server ever decrypting it. This allows us to handle massive volumes of  data and protect billions of users with incredible speed.

In an era of AI development, the languages we  choose are critical, so legibility and safety make it a great addition to your AI toolbox. Ten years ago this month, we open-sourced Swift and shared this incredible  language with the world, and the response has been remarkable. Today, Swift is available on Linux, Windows, Android, and  more. It's embraced by a vibrant community, and millions of developers globally are building apps from everything  from devices to data centers. It's time to consider Swift for your next project. Check out Swift.org for a language that's fast, expressive, and safe, running on the next generation  infrastructure of AWS and Graviton. And in case you haven't heard, there's now a native Swift toolchain  available for Amazon Linux, the first distribution to have an official package for the AWS and Swift on server community.  Thank you for your vision and your partnership. I'd also like to thank Dave for having me here today. We can't wait to see what you all create with Swift on AWS Graviton. Thank you.

### Lambda Managed Instances: Bridging Serverless Simplicity with EC2 Performance

The work that you and the team at Apple have been doing with Swift on Graviton is really impressive.  Now, one of the biggest transformations that the cloud brought was how quickly companies could move. Developers stopped waiting on hardware and instead could spin up resources in minutes and even seconds. That speed, the ability to experiment, to iterate, to fail fast and hopefully succeed fast, is now essential. Over the last 20 years, we've done more than just bring you faster computers. We've given you faster building blocks and tools that remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting so that you can focus your workloads and time and energy on what truly differentiates your business.

[![Thumbnail 1750](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1750.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1750)

Now, I want to take us back to 2013, a moment when a very small group of engineers within AWS asked a question that sounded almost impossible at  the time: What if a developer could just hand their code to AWS and have it run? No servers, no provisioning, no capacity planning, no scaling. The engineers that came up with this idea weren't even on the EC2 team because the EC2 team, myself included, was deeply focused on servers, instance types, auto-scaling groups, load balancers, and of course, putting Jitter where it belonged. When you're focused on servers, you don't naturally ask the question: what if there were no servers at all? But that was the breakthrough. The point wasn't to make servers simpler; it was to remove servers from the experience entirely. At the time, the S3 team was handling millions of thumbnails, profile pictures, product photos, and social media images all pouring into buckets across the  S3 fleet.

[![Thumbnail 1810](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1810.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1810)

 Every time a new image arrived, a lot of work had to be done. It had to be resized, cropped, and watermarked—whatever the application required. To do that, customers had to run fleets of EC2 instances, pull the image from S3, process it, and push back the results. Those servers, the scaling logic, and the orchestration were all managed by the customer, and it was a ton of undifferentiated heavy lifting triggered every time a new object arrived in S3.

[![Thumbnail 1860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1860)

[![Thumbnail 1870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/1870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=1870)

The S3 team had an elegant insight. If they attached a little bit of compute directly to the storage layer, they could run a small function the moment a new object landed. No fleets, no data shuttling, and no orchestration. Upload an image, compute runs, thumbnails  appear. That simple idea of bringing compute to data became the seed of something much larger.  As the concept evolved, we realized that it wasn't just about those thumbnails. This was a new application model. Customers didn't just want to run the logic when a new image arrived.  They wanted to react to database events, log systems, IoT messages, API calls—any event that the system may introduce.

When we launched Lambda in 2014, it changed the landscape for the first time.  Developers didn't start with servers. They started with code. Lambda handled the execution, the scaling, the availability, and the fleet. You only paid when your code ran. Lambda wasn't just a new service;  it was a new mindset. As customers immediately embraced it, startups moved faster. Enterprises modernized workloads that had been stuck for years. Event-driven architectures, real-time processing, data pipelines—whole new patterns emerged.

A decade later, Lambda still remains the fastest way to go from an idea to production. Customers love it because it removes so much of the operational weight. As usage grew, people pushed Lambda into new territories, so we kept expanding it.  More runtimes, container support, VPC networking, predictable performance options, SnapStart, and function URLs—all without adding any operational weight. But as usage grew even further, customers continued to push Lambda into new territory.  They wanted access to the latest EC2 technologies. They wanted predictable performance at very high scale. They wanted more network throughput.  They wanted submillisecond latency, and they didn't want to trade away any of Lambda's simplicity to get those things.

This created an inflection point. A couple of years ago, we brought the Lambda and EC2 teams under one organization for the first time ever.  When we did that, these two groups—one rooted in servers and one rooted in serverless—started looking at the entire space of compute together. We began to think of compute not as rigid boxes, EC2 containers, and serverless, but as a spectrum of choices. That naturally led us to a deeper question: What is serverless? Is it no service? Is it no operations? Is it don't make me think about the infrastructure? Is it just run my code?

Well, customers were telling us something clear. We love Lambda because we don't have to manage infrastructure,  but we want control over the performance. We do want access to the hardware that we need. So we asked ourselves another bold question.  Could we preserve everything that customers love about serverless—the simplicity, the automatic scaling, the operational model—while giving them the performance choice of EC2? This week, we're thrilled to answer that question with Lambda Managed Instances. 

[![Thumbnail 2080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2080)

Lambda Managed Instances elegantly bridges the gap between serverless simplicity and infrastructure control. With managed instances, your Lambda functions run on EC2 instances inside your account, and Lambda manages the provisioning, patching, availability, and scaling. You choose the instance type, you choose the hardware. Lambda handles the rest. It's the next evolution of serverless compute.  The best part? Your existing Lambda functions continue to work as is. No rearchitecture, no code changes, and no operational burden. You get the performance characteristics of EC2 with the developer experience of Lambda.  We think this opens the door to workloads that historically lived outside Lambda. Video processing, ML preprocessing, high throughput analytics.  And I'm sure there are many more. Lambda Managed Instances isn't a departure from serverless; it's an expansion of it.

[![Thumbnail 2110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2110)

It brings more choice, more performance, and more capability to customers without adding any operational weight. Serverless was never about the absence of servers. It was always about the absence of server management.  It's about removing the heavy lifting so developers can focus entirely on their code and their business logic. With managed instances, we're pushing that vision forward, giving builders the power of EC2 with the simplicity of Lambda and letting them move faster than ever before.

### Project Mantle: Redesigning Bedrock's Inference Engine for AI Workloads

Over the last year, we've seen a major shift in the types of workloads that customers are running.  Inference has obviously moved to the center, and it behaves very differently from traditional compute patterns that we've been optimizing for over the last two decades. As we dug into these workloads, it became clear that the elasticity that customers rely on in the cloud doesn't automatically transfer over to inference.  We've been focused on how to deliver that same flexibility, responsiveness, and efficiency that customers expect from AWS, even in a world where demand can spike instantly and the cost of getting it wrong is incredibly high.

[![Thumbnail 2210](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2210.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2210)

To understand why inference is such a hard problem, you have to look at what happens inside a single inference request. This is not just taking text in and getting text out. It's a four-stage pipeline: tokenization, prefill, decode, and detokenization.  Tokenization breaks the input into tokens that the model can understand.  Prefill processes that full prompt and builds the key-value cache that the model will use during the decode stage.  Decode generates the responses one token at a time, guided by that key-value cache, and then detokenization turns those tokens back into language that we can understand.

[![Thumbnail 2250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2250)

At any moment, you're running workloads that are CPU-bound, GPU compute-bound, memory bandwidth-bound, and latency-sensitive all at the same time.  Some requests are tiny, while others involve huge documents. Some must return immediately, and others can take their time. The resource profile of a single request changes dramatically as it moves through this pipeline.  Now imagine doing all of this at global scale with thousands of customers, millions of requests, and dozens of models, each with different shapes, sizes, and urgency. It's a completely different scaling challenge.

[![Thumbnail 2280](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2280.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2280)

To do it well, you need an architecture that can adapt in real time. If you were building an inference service from scratch, you might start with an architecture that we all know: a load balancer and a  fleet of accelerators. That model works well for many applications and is a proven and effective pattern for traditional web services.  When we built Bedrock, we started with some of these proven patterns, and they served you well. But as models evolved and usage grew, it became clear that inference needed a different architecture. 

[![Thumbnail 2330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2330)

We went back to the basics and asked: if we were designing an inference service today, with everything that we now know about running real customer workloads at massive scale, what would it look like? That's what led us to Project Mantle, a new inference engine that now powers many of Amazon Bedrock's models. One of the biggest insights was that not all inference requests have the same urgency. Instead of AWS guessing, we wanted to allow customers to tell us. 

[![Thumbnail 2350](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2350.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2350)

We launched Bedrock service tiers, allowing customers to assign their requests to one of three lanes: priority for real-time, latency-sensitive interactions; standard for steady and predictable workloads; and flexible for background jobs where efficiency matters more than speed.  This lets customers optimize what they care about, and it lets us allocate resources more intelligently. The result is consistent low latency for priority workloads while still driving optimized performance across everything else.

[![Thumbnail 2370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2370)

[![Thumbnail 2380](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2380.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2380)

The second major challenge that we addressed with Mantle was fairness. In a shared system, one customer's burst shouldn't degrade the performance of others.  Bedrock solves this by giving each customer their own queue. Your performance is determined by your usage, not someone else's.  If another customer spikes, it affects their queue, not yours. Because Bedrock learns your typical usage patterns, it anticipates how much capacity you're likely to need and ensures that it's available when you need it. This combination of queue isolation and adaptive capacity sharing gives customers much more predictable performance, even under heavy load.

When you put all this together—prioritization, fairness, smarter batching, better scheduling—you get significant improvements in how inference services operate at scale.

[![Thumbnail 2410](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2410.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2410)

These  gains manifest as follows: latency becomes more consistent, throughput increases, utilization improves, and the overall system becomes more resilient. But to make this architecture fully reliable, especially for long-running requests, we needed one more component: a durable record of work happening across the fleet. We call this the Journal.

[![Thumbnail 2440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2440)

The Journal already powers services like DynamoDB and S3 today, and it's a highly reliable and durable transaction log. Inference  requests can run for a long time, and if something fails—whether that's a hardware fault, a networking issue, or maybe just a retry—you don't want to restart the entire request because that wastes compute and increases latency. Now with Journal, Bedrock continuously captures the state of each request. If something goes wrong, you can resume exactly where you left  off. This makes the system far more fault tolerant and also enables advanced scheduling strategies that weren't possible before.

[![Thumbnail 2470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2470)

One of those advanced  scheduling strategies is fine tuning. Fine tuning is super compute intensive and can take hours. Traditional  systems require separate training environments and separate schedulers that often sit idle waiting for load. With Bedrock fine tuning becomes just a long-running job. If a surge of real-time traffic arrives, the fine tuning job pauses, and when that surge subsides, it resumes right where it left off. This now gives customers access to incredibly efficient fine tuning right within Bedrock without having to manage training clusters or worry about wasted compute.

[![Thumbnail 2540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2540)

As we redesigned the inference engine, we also raised the bar on security and privacy. Just as Nitro was done and transformed EC2 by creating a secure, isolated environment for compute, Bedrock integrates confidential computing to protect model weights and customer data during inference. Data is always encrypted and operators can't access the environment, and customers get cryptographic assurance that their requests ran in a verified and trusted place. Now,  for organizations with strict privacy and compliance needs, this is a huge step forward.

[![Thumbnail 2550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2550)

Because we have a strong, consistent, reliable foundation, we can integrate it deeply with  the rest of AWS. We've added tool calling support so your model can invoke Lambda functions for real-time data directly from Bedrock. We've added support for OpenAI's responses API for long-running jobs, and we've integrated with IAM for permissions and CloudWatch for observability. All the things that enterprises rely on to run  their most important workloads.

This isn't just about model hosting. It's a fully managed, production-ready platform for Generative AI, and everything we've built in Bedrock reflects what we've learned about operating services at massive scale for over nearly two decades. Inference is a new kind of compute. It has its own scaling patterns, its own constraints, and its own requirements. Bedrock gives us and you, our customers, the foundation to run those workloads reliably, efficiently, and securely. Behind every API is a sophisticated engine doing scheduling, fairness, resilience, and performance so customers can stay focused on building.

### Vector Search Across AWS: Nova Multimodal Embeddings Model

That's what we do at AWS. We take on the  hard problems, we solve them, and we give customers the tools that they need to invent the future. And with that, let me  hand it back to Peter. All right, thank you Dave. Now, I know Dave talked about innovating faster already, but we like innovating, so I'm going to talk a little bit more  about that. One of the ways that we like to innovate faster is by giving you access to important new capabilities across our broad range of services. I think a great example of this is the work we've been doing to enable vector search across AWS.

Now this is a picture of Smokey, or as he likes to be called, SmugMug.  You can see this isn't just a picture of Smokey. When we look at it, we don't just see pixels; we see physical attributes—bat ears, big tongue. We also see that expression that says, "I know what I did, I don't care." Your brain processes all these concepts and ideas simultaneously, and it understands the relationships and then connects it to other things. Perhaps you're thinking about your dog, or perhaps you're thinking about that messy eater you sat next to at dinner last night. These associations are sometimes strong and obvious, sometimes subtle.

That's what humans do. And vectors allow computers to work the same way. The simplest way to think about a vector is a data point that  places it in mathematical space. In our contrived example here, I have three dimensions. One represents color, another represents size, and another represents shape. You can see now that you can place images or ideas on these three axes. Now the exact location of where things get placed is not so interesting. What's interesting is the relative location of the  vector to other vectors. Very different objects like Christmas ornaments and apples or tennis balls and limes might  end up close together. It's these associations that are interesting in a vector search. Of course, what we have here isn't going to reveal anything particularly interesting, but  that's because we have a very simple, contrived example.

[![Thumbnail 2780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2780)

In the real world, vectors are far more than three dimensions. In fact, a rich vector encoding space today might have 3000  dimensions. You can see we struggle to illustrate that here. Each dimension isn't something as simple as size or  color. It's actually an undefined concept entirely, something itself generated by AI, a special kind of AI called  an Embedding Model. You train an Embedding Model on lots and lots of data, and the model itself starts recognizing patterns. It learns about different types of dog ears and  different shapes. With enough data, it learns to cluster these objects together in that mathematical space, sometimes in obvious ways but other times in surprising ways.

[![Thumbnail 2840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2840)

So, for example, you might be wondering what we do with these vectors. Well, as I said, the most interesting thing about vectors is when you search them in a database. This is where, unlike a traditional database that just stores rows and columns, a vector database is built  specifically to find nearest matches to these vectors. You encode your query and then it finds objects in the database, other vectors that are close to that. So in our example, all the French bulldogs might be clustered in one place and all the other dogs might be  clustered nearby. And cats, I'm not sure where the cats are clustered, but maybe the ones that like to destroy their toys are next to the French bulldogs.

[![Thumbnail 2880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2880)

Let's look at what vectors can do in the real world. Think about all the data your company has right now. Your institutional knowledge isn't organized into rows and columns that can be inserted into a database. It's buried in PDFs. It's captured in recorded video calls. Maybe there are some pictures of whiteboards that people have written on. It's  scattered in documents across dozens of systems. The challenge probably isn't that you don't have the data you need.  The problem is you can't find the data you need.

[![Thumbnail 2920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2920)

You might be thinking that creating a vector database might be a great way to find that data. And that is true. But unfortunately there's a challenge. Existing embedding models are highly specialized to handle certain types of data,  images or text. If you want to benefit from the wealth of unstructured data you might have, it means you likely have to combine models. But the catch is you can't really combine models because you can't search vectors across different embedding models, because those abstract dimensions that we talked about likely hold entirely different  concepts.

[![Thumbnail 2960](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/2960.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=2960)

This is precisely the challenge that we set out to handle with the new Nova Multimodal Embeddings model. This is a state-of-the-art embeddings model that supports text, documents, images, video, and audio. It converts all  of these concepts into a shared vector space, creating a unified understanding of your data. And better yet, the Nova Multimodal Embeddings model does this all with industry  leading accuracy. Having a great Embedding Model is only part of how we're enabling you to use vector search on your data. The real magic happens when the vector search capabilities are available on all of your data wherever it lives.

### S3 Vectors: Bringing Vector Search to AWS's Largest Data Service

If you think about how your teams work today, they're already deeply invested in specific databases and analytics platforms. When vector capabilities are built directly into these services, a couple of great things happen.

First, they don't need to invest time and energy to learn  a brand new vector database. And you don't need to pay for something entirely new. So you get agility and cost savings.  This is why at AWS we're approaching vectors the way we approach everything with both breadth and depth of capabilities. You don't need to learn an entirely new  technology stack or manage a complex data pipeline. We've integrated vector capabilities across our services. Let's take  a look at OpenSearch now.

[![Thumbnail 3070](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3070.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3070)

Amazon OpenSearch has long been a backbone of search and analytics, and it's well known for its exact match capabilities. But you're not just looking for exact match capabilities anymore. You want to ask questions in natural language and get intelligent responses. But that doesn't mean you want to give up the ability to run an exact match search either. So today, OpenSearch has evolved into a vector-driven intelligence engine.  With OpenSearch, you don't have to choose between traditional keyword search or semantic search. Hybrid search gives you the keyword-based precision, and semantic search allows you to get even better results.

[![Thumbnail 3110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3110)

Now you're probably thinking OpenSearch is a fairly obvious place for us to add vector capabilities, and I'd agree. In fact, we've added vector search capabilities to most of our database and analytics services. But we've also asked what would it mean if we brought the power of vector search to our largest data service? And with S3 Vectors, we brought the cost,  structure and scale of S3 to vector storage. This actually did surprise a few people, even those that know vectors quite well, because this isn't easy.

[![Thumbnail 3140](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3140.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3140)

What's great is you can create a vector index the exact same way you can create an S3 bucket, and this enables you to build vector databases of any size. With the simplicity of storing data in S3, no provisioning works at any scale. You pay for only what you use. It's that simple. Now, earlier this week,  we announced the general availability of S3 Vectors, which included some significant improvements to query performance and scale.  It turns out that searching for the closest vector in a high dimensional space on a massive vector database is really hard to find. The nearest neighbor, the exact nearest neighbor.  You essentially have to compare every vector in your database to the search database, and that requires doing lots of  math over all those dimensions. Even in a smaller database where you keep everything in memory, this is often too expensive.

[![Thumbnail 3180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3180)

So instead you typically employ something  called an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm. And there's a lot of innovation in these algorithms today. They're quite interesting. They don't guarantee the absolute closest vector, but they do pretty well. And they scale much better. But the challenge that we have with S3 is we aren't storing all these vectors in memory. We're storing them in more economical storage with S3. So how can we provide really low latency on search for vector databases that grow into the billions of vectors and need to run on S3?

[![Thumbnail 3230](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3230.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3230)

The approach the S3 team developed is to pre-compute a bunch of vector neighborhoods for every vector database. A good way to think about a vector neighborhood is a place where a bunch of vectors are clustered, perhaps French bulldogs or cats that destroy their toys, and these  neighborhoods are computed ahead of time offline, so they don't impact your query performance. And every time a new vector is inserted into S3, the vector gets added to one or more of these vector neighborhoods based on where it's located.

[![Thumbnail 3260](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3260.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3260)

[![Thumbnail 3280](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3280.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3280)

Now, when a user goes to execute a query, a much smaller search is done to find the nearby neighborhoods. The vectors that were in these vector  neighborhoods are loaded from S3 into fast memory, where the team then applies an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm, and this can all be done quite quickly, and it returns really good results. How well does this work? Turns out really well. We're seeing sub-100 millisecond query times  with vector databases with 2 billion vectors in production. That's the scale and performance of S3 Vectors. And it's going to open up all sorts of new use cases for customers.

[![Thumbnail 3300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3300)

The response to S3 Vectors has been great in just four months since we put it out in preview. Over 250,000 vector indexes  have been created, and we've ingested more than 4 billion vectors and performed over 1 billion vector searches.

### TwelveLabs: Turning Video into Searchable Intelligence with S3 Vectors

This type of adoption tells us we're on to something and we're solving a real customer problem. One of those early customers is using Amazon S3 Vectors to understand video the way humans do. Please welcome to the stage Jae Lee, CEO and co-founder of TwelveLabs.  

[![Thumbnail 3360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3360)

Thanks for having me, Peter. I'm incredibly excited to be here today. In fact, I wanted to watch all of Peter's past keynotes to prepare, but I've been really busy running TwelveLabs and needed help. So I decided to have our models watch the keynotes for me.  I indexed over 12 hours of keynotes from the last eight years and asked our models to analyze them to pick out the key insights.  First, I asked what are Peter's favorite topics to talk about, and I learned really quickly that these are his favorites.  Then I searched for the clips where Peter is talking about these topics, and it was really easy for me to find and watch specific clips from each of his keynotes.

[![Thumbnail 3400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3400)

What started as a fun way to do my research was actually a perfect example of what TwelveLabs does every day: turning hours of video into structured intelligence.  We're living in a world where about 90 percent of data today is unstructured, and most of that by far comes from video. But even though video is the biggest source of data, it's also incredibly complex. It combines visuals, audio, movement, and most importantly, time.   

[![Thumbnail 3460](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3460.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3460)

[![Thumbnail 3470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3470)

Now, combine that across petabytes of footage in industries like media, entertainment, law enforcement, and enterprises of every kind. That's millions and millions of hours of video. Did you know that 1 million hours of video is equivalent to 114 years if you watch it straight through? The scale is absolutely staggering, and finding meaning in it, finding the moments that matter, is even harder. At TwelveLabs, we're building Foundation Models that understand video the way humans do, not as a sequence of frames or transcripts, but as a unified story across sight, sound, and time.  

[![Thumbnail 3480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3480)

Our models, Marengo and Pegasus, are some of the heaviest multi-petabyte scale video AI workloads in the world, running inference on millions of hours of video.  Marengo is our multi-modal Embedding Model that powers precise video search and retrieval. Our latest version, Marengo 3, allows you to find the moments that matter across your massive archives using any-to-any modality search. Pegasus is our video language model that turns video into insights. It performs deep analysis and excels at generating text like summaries, captions, or metadata to power downstream video workflows.

TwelveLabs was born on AWS. From the beginning, the AWS startup programs and credits literally changed our trajectory. Those credits didn't just help us train models; they gave us the momentum to productize our research. Running our stack on AWS shortens the distance between innovation and deployment for us.   The backbone of our data infrastructure is on Amazon S3. When a customer sends requests to one of our model APIs on the TwelveLabs platform, the system seamlessly ingests, indexes, and embeds video at petabyte scale without ever moving their data out of S3.  

[![Thumbnail 3580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3580)

Now, as capable as our models are, they require equally competent vector storage. What unlocked innovation for our Marengo model was the integration of Amazon S3 Vectors to deliver an optimized video intelligence offering at scale.  Vectors are at the heart of what we do. Each scene, audio segment, text, and video gets encoded by Marengo into a multi-dimensional vector embedding that captures semantic meaning across space and time.  

Now, what does that look like? Let's assume for a single audio video that's thousands of vectors. But we're talking about customers processing millions of hours of video. That's billions of embeddings. These embeddings flow directly into S3 Vectors indices.

[![Thumbnail 3620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3620)

 There is no data migration and no rearchitecting of the infrastructure. The same S3 buckets already storing the source video now store the embeddings that make it searchable with the same durability and scalability guarantee. 

[![Thumbnail 3640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3640.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3640)

For example, when a user types a natural language query like "people watching a space shuttle take off from a distance," the query gets embedded by Marengo into the same vector space.  S3 Vectors then performs an approximate nearest neighbor search across billions of stored embeddings and returns video results with metadata like video IDs and timestamps that pinpoint the moment that matched the query.  From there, our customers can take these video results and use them to power downstream video tools and workflows.

Now one of our customers, ArcXP, is a perfect example.  An extension of the Washington Post, they provide a media management platform powering news organizations around the world. Built on S3, ArcXP enables editorial teams to not only store and manage their massive archives, but now they can personalize the stories they create with it.  A single video or article can be transformed into tailored variations for different audiences.  They leverage TwelveLabs models to quickly analyze and enrich archived video content and discover related clips to build new stories. 

[![Thumbnail 3740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3740.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3740)

That is what accessibility means to us: not just APIs, but infrastructure on AWS that makes video intelligence viable at any scale. Our partnership with S3 enables us to deliver an incredibly efficient product offering directly to our customers' infrastructure. Given the scale of the data we handle, that has a meaningful impact on our customers' unit economics, which unlocks new possibilities.

I started by telling you I used our own models to prepare for this keynote. That is not just a demo trick. For decades, video has been a write-only medium, but now we capture everything: every game, every meeting, every moment. But we could not find it, learn from it, or build on it. Today that has changed.  We are turning the world's video into knowledge that is actually usable. Every organization has their own version of institutional knowledge trapped in video footage that could teach you something if you could only ask it a question. And now you can.   We cannot wait to see what you build. Thank you.

### Trainium3 UltraServer: 360 PetaFLOPS and 20TB of High Bandwidth Memory

Earlier, Dave covered the work we are doing with Graviton to lower cost and improve performance.  There is no place where we are making deeper investments in our infrastructure than supporting AI workloads, and the reason is pretty easy to understand. AI workloads are growing explosively and running these workloads is expensive, power hungry, and capacity constrained. That is why we built Trainium. Trainium supports almost every imaginable AI workload.

[![Thumbnail 3830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3830)

[![Thumbnail 3840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3840)

Our naming convention is not ideal, but as you have heard, Trainium is optimized for both training and inference.  If you are using Anthropic models, whether from Bedrock or from their one P, you are probably already benefiting from Trainium.  Trainium supports the full spectrum of model architectures, from dense transformers to Mixture of Experts to State Space Models, and it supports all sorts of modalities: text, image, video, you name it. Simply put, Trainium can handle every AI workload that you want to run today and anything you can imagine building.

[![Thumbnail 3870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3870)

Trainium supports all these workloads with great performance.  Performance can mean lots of things. It can mean building the largest training cluster like Project Rainier, or it can mean processing an inference request and generating your answer as quickly as possible at the best possible efficiency.  There are lots of ways to optimize performance, but Trainium gives builders the tools to deliver great performance with their models and applications. Trainium supports these workloads at meaningfully lower costs.  As you have heard this week, Trainium3 will provide up to 40 percent lower cost than even the most demanding AI workloads. That is a big deal when you are spending tens of millions of dollars.

[![Thumbnail 3920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3920)

Lower cost is a big deal when you're spending tens of billions of dollars on infrastructure. Let me show you a little bit more about how we're achieving this. This is our second generation Trainium UltraServer.  An UltraServer is where we combine lots of Trainium servers into a single AI supercomputer.  This second generation is a significant step forward from the first generation we launched last year. First, it's based on Trainium3 chips, and there are lots of them. There are 144 Trainium3 chips across two racks combined into a single UltraServer.

[![Thumbnail 3960](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/3960.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=3960)

I want to draw your attention to the devices in the middle of these racks. Those are neuron switches, and they're used to interconnect all the Trainium3 chips in this rack to create that one massive AI supercomputer. These are not your typical network switches.  These switches are specifically designed to provide full bisectional bandwidth at extremely low latencies directly to those training chips.  So what kind of performance can this provide? The key performance dimensions that matter in AI supercomputers are compute and memory.  This UltraServer has a lot of both: 360 PetaFLOPS of eight-bit precision floating-point compute and 20TB of High Bandwidth Memory with 700TB per second memory bandwidth.  That's 4.4 times higher raw compute performance and 3.9 times more bandwidth than last year's Trainium UltraServer, making it one of the most powerful AI supercomputers available, allowing us to run or build even the very largest models.

[![Thumbnail 4030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4030)

Let's take a closer look. These are just sticker stats, and you have to look deeper than the sticker stats.  Let's take a closer look at the Trainium3 server and chip to understand how they're able to deliver great performance and differentiated cost. This is one of the Trainium sleds. You could pull this right out of the UltraServer. There are 36 of these sleds interconnected with all those neuron switches in one of those UltraServers.  Let me point out a few really cool things. First, this represents our first system where we use all three AWS custom-designed chips on the same server board. You'll see the four Trainium3 accelerators are located on the far end of the board, and right next to those is a Graviton processor. 

[![Thumbnail 4110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4110)

[![Thumbnail 4130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4130.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4130)

Graviton gives us the high-speed I/O necessary to keep these accelerators busy. By having Graviton co-located on the same sled as the Trainium, we avoid the need for a dedicated head node in our rack. That gives us additional space to build an even bigger UltraServer. Additionally, having that Graviton server there lets us do maintenance on just this one sled without taking the other sleds out of production. That has the benefit of keeping our capacity where it should be in production, running your code. Speaking of maintenance, another key differentiator you can see here is that everything is top serviceable on this sled.  This is unique with an AI server.  This design pays dividends in a few ways. First, it enables entirely robotic assembly of the server, which lets us put these Trainium chips into our fleet faster. Second, when we need to service these systems in production, we can do it quickly and efficiently.

[![Thumbnail 4140](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4140.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4140)

Finally, you'll see that we have two Nitro cards to provide very high-speed networking.  Nitro enables EFA, or Elastic Fabric Adapter, which enables Trainium servers to share memory with thousands of other Trainium servers, directly reading and writing from each other's memory over encrypted channels with built-in network multipathing and fault tolerance. That's exactly what you need if you want to build a massive training cluster and build a big model. Building a great system is only part of the story. You need a great chip.  Building a great chip is the result of relentless execution over a long period of time, and that's what we've been doing with Trainium. We've been working with our customers, internal and external, for many years. Every time we build a new chip, we learn from how customers use it, and that learning fuels our future generations. It's a cycle of customer-driven innovation. We don't focus on benchmarks. We focus on real customer workloads and find innovative ways to make those workloads more productive.

### Trainium's Software Stack: NKI, Neuron Profiler, and PyTorch Native Support

So what does that look like? On Trainium, we've added a number of microarchitectural capabilities to Trainium. Optimizations like this don't show up on the sticker, but all of these new  optimizations make Trainium run more efficiently.

We're solving common machine learning problems. Take microscaling, which allows you to use lower precision floating point numbers while preserving the accuracy of the models. The larger parameters, faster softmax, tensor dereference, or background transpose—these optimize common AI computing problems and free up the compute engines to do other work. Or take things like traffic shaping, memory addwrite, or hash spraying. These make your memory and network more efficient, and that keeps your Trainium chips fed with the data.

[![Thumbnail 4260](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4260.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4260)

[![Thumbnail 4270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4270)

Because while AI chips might provide  hundreds of trillions of floating point calculations on their spec sheet, that only matters if you can keep the data  flowing into the compute engines. Now, almost every AI workload that we're aware of will benefit from one or likely multiple of these new chip capabilities.

[![Thumbnail 4290](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4290.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4290)

[![Thumbnail 4300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4300)

This is a good time to mention that it's not just about having the best chip or the best hardware. You need the right tools to build  on that hardware, and this is where investing deeply to differentiate Trainium for customers looking to extract  every bit of performance they need to control things like memory allocation and pipeline depth to maximize the performance of their workload.

Our solution here starts with NKI, or the Neuron Kernel Interface. It's a language that combines the simplicity of matrix operations with direct instruction level access to all of Trainium hardware capabilities, all done inside a familiar Python programming environment. Those features we just looked at are all accessible from NKI.

[![Thumbnail 4340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4340)

[![Thumbnail 4360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4360)

Take Decart AI, for example. That's  the company that built the cool application that turned me into a cartoon of Werner earlier this morning that was running on Trainium3. Decart AI used NKI to optimize their real time video generation models on Trainium3 and reported drastically faster performance on Trainium3 than any other hardware platform they tested. They told us the  optimization process with NKI was quick and intuitive.

[![Thumbnail 4370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4370)

Now they're going to be up on stage in a minute to tell you more  about this. Which brings me to today's update on NKI. NKI is going to be generally available in Q1, and we're really excited to get this powerful tool in more of our customers' hands. We're also open sourcing all aspects of the Neuron NKI stack.

Nothing is worse than a compiler surprising you when you're working. Having complete visibility into the compiler and the code stack is going to make it even easier for you to get maximum performance from the hardware. Now, if you've ever worked on deep performance engineering, you know that your best friend is strong coffee and a great profiler. A profiler lets you see what's happening on the hardware in detail—where are the bottlenecks, where should I focus my attention?

[![Thumbnail 4420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4420)

That's exactly what we provide with  the Neuron Profiler. But here's what makes it special. Trainium has dedicated hardware capabilities on the chip for profiling your code without impacting performance, and this means you can profile actual production code running in a real environment and you can get instruction level precision. So you have all the information you need to optimize your code.

[![Thumbnail 4460](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4460.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4460)

[![Thumbnail 4470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4470)

And today I'm excited to share that we've taken it one step further with Neuron Explorer. Neuron Explorer takes all that detailed profiling data and presents it in an intuitive interface that makes it easy to  understand what's happening and to identify opportunities for improvement. In fact, Neuron Explorer automatically detects your bottlenecks and suggests optimizations. This allows you  to spend more time fixing things and less time hunting for problems.

[![Thumbnail 4480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4480)

[![Thumbnail 4490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4490)

We've looked a lot at how we are investing for great performance for Trainium3 and the tools you  can use to achieve that, but let's look at those actual performance numbers. Here's the open source GPT-OSS 120 billion  parameter model from OpenAI, running on both Trainium2 UltraServers and Trainium3 UltraServers. Now, as I mentioned, the Trainium3 UltraServer has 4.4 times more compute than that Trainium2 UltraServer. So to make this a fair fight, we normalized everything to output tokens per megawatt.

Look at these gains: five times higher output tokens per megawatt while maintaining the same user-visible latency. This should give you a sense of why we're so excited about Trainium3. For those of you interested in going deeper, we'll be open sourcing this code, including the relevant NKI kernels so you can learn from it and reuse it.

[![Thumbnail 4540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4540)

[![Thumbnail 4560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4560.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4560)

I've covered a lot about how we built Trainium to run any AI workload you can throw at it,  and how we're working to make it possible to get differentiated performance and lower costs with Trainium. But we have been working on one more really important thing that's making it easy for everyone to use Trainium without having to learn a whole new chip and a whole new programming language. That's why I'm thrilled to share that  Trainium is becoming PyTorch native.

[![Thumbnail 4570](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4570.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4570)

[![Thumbnail 4600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4600)

What does this mean? Let me show you. Here's  the code that's running our model on NVIDIA GPUs. Now, if we change the simple line from cuda to neuron, we're ready to run on Trainium. That's it. That's all it takes. Now everyone—researchers, students, even Dave—can use Trainium without having to run a brand new software stack. This seamless integration is made possible by phenomenal  work from the PyTorch team, allowing us to support different backends. We already have this working with some customers, and we expect to release it broadly early in the  new year.

### Decart AI: Real-Time Visual Intelligence Powered by Trainium3

Of course, the most exciting thing about building chips is getting them in our customers' hands. With Trainium3, we're delighted with the early feedback from our customers, and our partnership with Anthropic is a great example of our deep collaboration with customers that's helping us produce leading AI accelerators. We're also excited about some of the innovative startups that are doing new and exciting things with Trainium right now. I want to bring one of those customers on stage already  building with Trainium3 and NKI. Please join me in welcoming Dean Leitersdorf, CEO of Decart.

Thank you, Peter. It's exciting to announce what we've been  working on together. Today I'm going to show you something that's completely new, something the world hasn't seen before. It's a new category of GenAI Foundation Models called real-time live visual intelligence. Take a look at the screens to my left and right. We're all here right now at re:Invent. But what if we want it to be all powered up? Earlier, when Peter walked on stage, he looked like Werner  and that was our model's art. Decart Foundation Models running on Trainium3 live. Every pixel you see right now  is being generated on this stage in real time.

At Decart, we're an efficiency-first AI research lab, and we're building foundational models for visual intelligence. Vision is how we see the world. It's how we communicate. It's  how humans understand each other, and it's how robots will be able to understand our world and train themselves in generative simulations. This is what video and world  models are all about, and it's happening right now live. For the first time, we could take foundational models for LLMs and video diffusion models and get them to run at the same time with zero latency. Trainium3 has been a huge  enabler for our workload and for creating this new GenAI category of real-time visual intelligence.

[![Thumbnail 4790](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4790.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4790)

[![Thumbnail 4800](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4800.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4800)

At Decart, we have a lot of proprietary IP that allows us to train and inference models much faster and more efficiently. We worked closely with the AWS team to port our model stack and infrastructure to Trainium, allowing us to work with  Trainium for building and running models. We optimized it all using NKI language, which Peter just talked about, and it made the transition much faster than what we expected. We're on a path to getting four times better performance in frames per second than what we can do with state-of-the-art GPUs. It's eighty percent  Tensor Core utilization. These are metrics we just don't hear of in AI. The reason we get this performance is a  result of how we combine Trainium and our models.

[![Thumbnail 4820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4820)

The models that we train at Decart have three components. An LLM that does reasoning and understands the world, a video model that understands pixels and structure, and an encoder that lets the two connect and run together. Usually we have to run these in sequence one after the other.  But we're able to build a Trainium megakernel that we wrote, and it got all three to run at the same time with zero latency on the same chip, achieving maximum HBM memory utilization and tensor engine utilization all at the same time with no latency.

[![Thumbnail 4840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4840)

We're already seeing how our models are changing how we behave online. On Twitch, we have  streamers that create new, compelling experiences with our audiences. In shopping, imagine you see this cool lamp, and before you buy it, you see it next time you watch a movie. It gets placed in that movie just for you. We're trying to make sure that every product before you buy it online, you can try it on yourself and in your home, see what you feel about it, and see how it looks.

[![Thumbnail 4870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4870)

One of the experiences I love most is  basketball. You're watching the game and to keep your kids engaged, you let them watch the Decart AI cartoon version, which is being generated live from the match. We're taking AI and putting it into live sports in the arena and in your living rooms. For gaming, we're creating a completely new foundation where games generate themselves as  they're being played.

[![Thumbnail 4910](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4910.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4910)

Frankly, everything you just saw, all these experiences, we didn't come up with them. It was builders, it was developers that took our API. You know your industry's way better than we do, and you can understand how to take these models and extract value out of  them for your customers and for your industries.

[![Thumbnail 4920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/4920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=4920)

If we step into the future, a few years into the future, I really believe in taking this tech to robotics and simulations.  Robots are already using models like this to envision infinite possibilities and infinite outcomes on the road, in homes, factories, and manufacturing. In the future, we'll be able to  train robots fully in generative simulations before they ever hit the ground. When they hit the ground, they will use live visual intelligence to understand the  world around them and to understand the human environment.

I'm really excited to be here and announce with  AWS this new category of GenAI Live Visual Intelligence. We're taking it to every industry, every market at any scale, powered by Trainium3 using the Decart models. Everything we build, we put it on our API. Every few weeks, we launch it  at our mobile app and the world is shifting. For the first time, we can take stuff that's in our imagination and connect it to what we see with our eyes in reality, live. I really can't   wait to see what all of you build with it. Thank you all.

### Closing Thoughts: The Fundamentals Matter More Than Ever in the AI Era

Well, we started out this  morning by asking what AI means for our infrastructure. After everything we've explored, I hope the answer is clear. The fundamentals matter more than ever. Security, availability, elasticity, agility, and cost. These aren't relics of a pre-AI world. They're the foundation upon which the future applications will be built on.

[![Thumbnail 5030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/5030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=5030)

The investments we've made from Nitro to Graviton to Lambda weren't just about solving yesterday's problems. They were about preparing for exactly this moment. Today you saw what that preparation looks like.  Graviton5 delivers 192 cores in a big cache. Lambda managed instances expand the meaning of serverless, vectors become the connective tissue of your data, and Trainium3 brings great performance and lower cost to every AI workload you can imagine.

[![Thumbnail 5080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/15d898e9121f19fc/5080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeUpUK0nhC0&t=5080)

But here's what excites me the most. It's still day one with AI. There are going to be twists and turns that none of us can predict. New architectures will emerge, new possibilities will unfold, and AWS will be here, just like we've been for the past 20 years. Removing constraints, providing building blocks, and helping you navigate whatever's next. So what will you build next? But first, remember, don't miss the closing keynote with Werner. Thank you and enjoy the rest of your week.
