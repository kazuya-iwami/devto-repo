### Introduction to Q Developer for SAP Workloads: Transforming the Development Lifecycle

 Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm really excited and happy to have you here. You are attending a session about Q Developer and Q Developer capabilities for SAP workloads on AWS. In today's presentation, we will demonstrate how Q Developer can help you and your customers with building their applications, developing code, and creating documentation. We will dive deep into this in a moment. But before we actually start, I wanted to ask you: has anyone here already tried to use an AI assistant for programming purposes? I see some of you have. Great! How did you like it? Did it give you any beneficial results? Good, I'm glad to hear that. Today we'll present how Q Developer can help you as well.

I'm Shirli Cohen. Nice to meet you. I'm a Senior SAP Specialist Solution Architect here at AWS, and in my position, I help customers with migration and modernization of SAP workloads in the cloud. Together with me is my colleague Harshavardhan Padaval. Hello everyone, my name is Harshavardhan Padaval. I'm also a Specialist Solution Architect here at AWS. I have about 8.5 years of web development experience, and with AWS, my main work stream is to figure out how we can integrate all these AWS Gen AI suite of services with SAP for the betterment of our customers.

Just to let you know, we have prepared a lot of demonstrations for you, but we encourage you to ask questions and to raise issues that you encounter in your day-to-day work. Maybe we can see how we can address them in this session right now. I'm sure it will be beneficial for most of you.

[![Thumbnail 110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=110)

 In today's session, we will talk about the Gen AI stack for AWS. We will mention it in a few sentences, then we will dive deep into Q Developer and different use cases, for example, for documentation, for code generation, and for code conversion. We will showcase the new ABAP Accelerator, the extension for Q Developer. Harshavardhan will dive deep into this very important topic. Of course, we will leave some time for Q&A, but again, if you have any questions along the session, please feel free to raise your hand and let's continue.

[![Thumbnail 150](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/150.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=150)

[![Thumbnail 160](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/160.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=160)

  Let's talk about the Gen AI suite for SAP on AWS. We have the new platform Amazon Quick Suite. Amazon Quick Suite is a platform where you can actually connect different connectors, for example, Outlook, Jira, and other different systems, including calling different APIs and servers. Then you can build on top of them automations and flows. You can use Amazon Q on Quick Suite to build dashboards with only natural language. You can build stories and summarization of your dashboards. We also have Amazon Q Automate. Amazon Q Automate is the new IDE from Amazon where you can actually build web coding programming and also use development based on specifications. We can also have Amazon Bedrock, which you can use to build automations and machine learning-based applications. With the use of Agent Core, which is the new feature in Amazon Bedrock, you can build standalone agents for your day-to-day use in your companies. But today we will dive deep into Q Developer and we will talk about the ABAP Accelerator for Q Developer.

 Q Developer is not just an AI system for programming. It's called Q Developer, so the automatic thought is that it helps you develop. But actually, Q Developer is a tool that can assist you with the entire development lifecycle. When we are speaking about SAP lifecycle for development, we are talking about specification documents, the development itself, and theory applications. Theory applications could be on UI5 or could be on BTP, so there are different options. We also support different versions of SAP, for example, ECC and S/4HANA. Are there any people here that still run on SAP ECC? Yes, many of you. Q Developer can help you also with migrating either to the cloud with RISE and also to S/4HANA.

### Addressing Legacy Code Documentation Challenges in SAP Environments

 So Shirli, I have a good question for you. A couple of weeks back, I was having a conversation with one of our customers, a major automotive manufacturing company.

They have developed approximately 10,000 to 15,000 objects over the span of 15 years. They are now trying to modernize and move forward, and they asked me an important question: all these objects that they created, the developers who built them have left the organization, and nobody knows what exactly the applications do or what the objects, reports, RFCs, or function models actually accomplish. They wanted to know if Q Developer could address this situation.

This is a very common scenario. Customers often have stable and quite old legacy systems where programs were developed five, ten, fifteen, or even twenty years ago. What we want to do is try to understand what we see in the code so that we can extend it. I was a former consultant for SAP, working as a functional consultant. Many times when I came to different organizations, I saw very old programs where the developers were no longer with the company and the consultants kept changing, so nobody actually knew what was written in the program itself.

[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=430)

[![Thumbnail 440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=440)

Any time I wanted to debug it, which is very time consuming and could be very complex and frustrating, or any time I wanted to extend it, or whenever somebody encountered a bug that we wanted to fix, it was very difficult for us conceptually. It meant that we needed to invest a lot of time and effort into actually understanding what we had there because we never wanted to lose the functionality of the program. With the help of Q Developer, we can scan through ABAP code.  This is my Z program in the SAP environment. Here you can see how I actually use Q Developer on VS Code. You see this little icon.  I asked Q Developer to help me figure out what this code says because this is the basis for everything. I cannot really change something or extend something if I do not understand what is written currently in the code.

[![Thumbnail 470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=470)

[![Thumbnail 480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=480)

[![Thumbnail 490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=490)

[![Thumbnail 500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/500.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=500)

[![Thumbnail 520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=520)

So I asked Q Developer to please review the code. In this case, what you see is just copy-paste as a prompt to VS Code in the chat box for Q, but of course it can integrate with your system and your environment, and we will see examples for this later in the session.  What I asked was to please create a specification document for me and explain what I see in this code. The explanation is both functional  and technical.  It starts with the scope and the purpose of the program. It tells me who are the stakeholders for this program, who would actually benefit from it, or who would have to test it after I make the changes.  Then it goes down into details that are more technical, such as what classes are being used or what tables are being used, so that I would know what can be affected. It even gives me some quality recommendations for the code so I can improve my program as well. 

### Automating Specification Documents: From Business Requirements to Technical Design

We saw that we can create documentation, but if I think about the normal or standard lifecycle for SAP program development, we start basically from the consultant, or we start from the end user. The end user comes to the consultant like myself and asks for an application, a program, a report, or something they want me to do for them. Then what usually happens is that I would go back and forth with them to understand what they actually need and to understand the business requirements. After that, I would try to write it. I would have to write the functional design, get approval from the end user, and they would tell me whether it is okay or if I need to change or add something. Then I need to take this up with the developer and write the technical specification document, which is not very easy for me as a consultant and takes time.

[![Thumbnail 590](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/590.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=590)

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=600)

With the help of Q Developer, we can automate this process and ask Q Developer to write the document that I want.  In this example, I show you how Q Developer can write the specification documents based on the prompts.  If I explain to it what is the purpose and what is the objective of this program, because this is what the customer wanted, maybe they did not know how to tell me or exactly what they want.

[![Thumbnail 610](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/610.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=610)

[![Thumbnail 620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=620)

[![Thumbnail 630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=630)

[![Thumbnail 640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/640.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=640)

[![Thumbnail 650](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/650.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=650)

But he told me what his purpose is.  In this case, he wanted to see how we can find discrepancies in the purchase order. So discrepancies could be with quantity, could be with price,  could be between the delivery of the GR process, and could be with the invoice. So I'm just telling you that this is what I want to achieve. I want to understand the discrepancies, and he wrote a full specification document. Now let's say that I approve it or let's say that I  send it to my end user and he approved it. Now I need to create a technical document for that. So Q Developer created a full structure,  a full design of how the technical specification would look like with structured suggestions, like for example, which classes to use,  how the classes will be built, what tables to use, what fields, and all of this from just the prompt that explains the objective of the program that we want to write.

So Shirli, I have another question for you now that you are mentioning about requirement gathering from the end users. When I was working as an ABAP developer, we used to get our requirements for developing an ABAP application or an object from our functional counterparts. And sometimes what used to happen is some points or some functionalities are lost in translation, and we had to go in an iterative loop in order to get everything on board for our end users. Is there something that we can do with Q Developer that will help the function consultant itself to develop something out of the box, like a quick POC or a demo for the end users that they can show?

Yeah, so you know what happens, right? Because as a functional consultant, I have a lot of experience with end users. They ask what they want to ask, which is fine and great, and then I go to the programmer and I ask him to do it. Let's say that he does exactly what was required from him. It happened many times for me that when I came back to the end user, he told me, okay, listen, that's great. It looks fine, but this is not actually what I wanted. Can you maybe add a pop-up here or maybe I want to double-click and get to the transaction, or maybe add some more details in this header. So all of this could be resolved if they would actually see the application before I actually go and develop it and ask the programmer to invest his time in programming it.

### Rapid Prototyping with Business Application Studio: Creating Fiori Applications from Sketches

Because otherwise what happens is that I go back to the end user and then he tells me to add some more features, and then I go back to the other pair and then the other pair tells me, okay, but I don't have time, stand in line, or I will try to do my best, and then it takes more time. So the development cycle is much longer. It could be faster. Basically, Q Developer, if I use it in Business Application Studio on BTP, you see that I can install Q here as an extension as well. And then I can use the UI features or the UI folders that we have here to basically develop the theory application or the front-end screens before they actually create the program itself.

[![Thumbnail 680](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/680.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=680)

[![Thumbnail 840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=840)

[![Thumbnail 860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=860)

[![Thumbnail 880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=880)

[![Thumbnail 890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=890)

So in this case, I can sit with the end user, draw with him in the notebook. What we have here is actually a request to develop a dashboard for the production manager to just show him how many production orders are still open, how many production orders still need to be created, and so on.  And create some sort of dashboard to see some details. As you can see, I drew a picture with a few boxes inside it which are like buttons, so in each button I expect to see something different. Only from this drawing, Q Developer  actually understood or scanned the page, the picture to understand what we see here. So he understood that I have buttons, I have a logic behind the buttons, and let's skip a little bit in order to see what it actually developed.   

[![Thumbnail 940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=940)

From an ABAP developer's perspective, when we do object-oriented ABAP programming, we have class diagrams and everything. We can provide those diagrams to Q Developer and ask it to build a class for us. Basically, we can ask it to scan the page, build the application, and confirm it with the end user. You can see all the buttons that were created on the screen, and if the user wants to add something, I can do it directly in this session, in this meeting with them, and only then get to the developer. 

[![Thumbnail 970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=970)

If you work with the UI/UX team, I will try to run it from here and not touch it. When you work with the UI/UX team, they will provide you a picture, an image of exactly what the application is supposed to look like. In this case, they will give you the exact colors and the exact sizes in inches and everything that the picture is supposed to look like. 

[![Thumbnail 980](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/980.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=980)

[![Thumbnail 990](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/990.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=990)

[![Thumbnail 1000](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1000.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1000)

[![Thumbnail 1010](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1010.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1010)

[![Thumbnail 1020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1020.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1020)

[![Thumbnail 1030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1030)

So in this case, we can just upload the picture with the metadata behind it, if we have it, and then ask it to produce the application directly.  I don't want to touch it now because I'm afraid that it will not allow me, but you can see in just a few minutes how it actually creates everything.  You can see initially that it scans the documents, scans the image, and maps all the fields that we can actually see in the layout.  It actually identifies the icons and the sizes and everything that needs to be extracted.  If I have checkboxes as well, it connects to the tables behind the scenes that it should draw the data from. We can also use mock data because maybe initially we don't want to link it to anything yet, but then later on we can.  

[![Thumbnail 1040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1040)

[![Thumbnail 1080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1080)

So you saw the image initially and this is what was created for us. The checkboxes were created automatically. The columns, the selection screens, or the filters, the titles, the header—the icon did not come. So it's not perfect, it's not 100%, but you can see the colors as well. You can see the option to change the document. In this case it's requisitions, but of course this is a very good start. Instead of the user having to build it themselves, you get it in one sentence. You just upload the picture and ask it to create it, and then it gets created.  Now this is a very good base to start your programming. 

[![Thumbnail 1090](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1090.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1090)

[![Thumbnail 1120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1120)

[![Thumbnail 1130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1130.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1130)

So if you don't like what you see or if you are missing some details, you can also chat with Q.  You have this chat box, and you can write the text of what you want to create. In this use case, we try to create an application using the BTP features. We open a project and then choose what format we want to use. We get created an LLV type of front-end screen.  It's like a report, but what we see behind the report is that when I want to double-click it, you will see in a second, I don't get anything down because that means I need to program the other screens as well.  If I want it to be double-click and create something behind it, then I need to define it. In this case it's not being defined because I didn't do it myself, so you see the screen is empty.

[![Thumbnail 1200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1200.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1200)

So instead of going back and building it myself, what I asked is that I explained to Q the details of the documents were not created. Since they're not created, please build them for me. I didn't even tell it what details I wanted. I could have told it I want the delivery, I want the quantity, I want to be able to edit it, I want to create a pop-up screen, and so on. In this case I didn't say it and I expected Q to understand by itself according to the business logic and the document that was created initially.  So you see, I explained that it's empty, so it knows where it needs to intervene. By the way, Q supports multiple languages.

[![Thumbnail 1220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1220)

If your customers are not from the US or UK, it is perfectly fine to write in a different language. Q Developer supports many languages, and we can check according to your needs. Do you have any questions so far?

### Natural Language Development: Building Functional Applications with Q Developer

Let's see what was created.  I have a general question. It seems like you showed a few different tools. Which tools are you actually showing here?  Would the same thing work, for example, in Hero or VS Code? What is behind it that matters? What are the actual tools that are able to do all this?

I am referring to Q Developer, and Q Developer can be installed either on BTP, which is what we see in this example,  or in VS Code. BTP is also based on VS Code. It can also be installed in Eclipse, and QO is based on Q Developer.  So all those tools that you develop with—yes, exactly. By the way, it does not work only for ABAP or for SAP workloads.  You can create applications with other programming languages as well. Here you can see the screen that was created based on my natural language request. I just asked to create the second screen, and you can see that I have the option to edit.

Since Q Developer understood the context of the document being used here, it allowed me to change the quantity in this case, and it integrates to my environment automatically.  So in natural language, I can create a full functional application, not only the front end, but also the integration to my SAP environment.

[![Thumbnail 1330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1330)

Until now, we saw documentation, and we saw how Q Developer can assist functional consultants with either documentation, creating functional specifications or technical specifications, and also documenting existing code, which is very helpful in order to understand what happened in your organization years before.  We can also now interact with end users in order to build theory applications, something that is going to be very visual with the end user so they can understand what they are going to get from this development. 

But let me ask you something. Regardless of this, which is great, what would it mean about the ABAP code, for example? I mean, if I think about companies that we saw are now running ECC and in the future, hopefully soon, maybe they would want to migrate to Rise in the cloud or maybe SAP native in the cloud or just do an S/4HANA upgrade. What can Q Developer help us achieve in this move?

### Introducing ABAP Accelerator: An MCP Server-Based Extension for SAP Migration

Actually, that is the same question I had when I was exploring Amazon Q Developer specifically for ABAP development.  The main challenge that we have for ABAP development is code compilation, syntax checks, and ATC checks, and all those things. Unlike open source programming languages like Node.js or Python, where we install dependencies and packages—NPM packages, PIP packages—which help us with code compilation, when it comes to ABAP development, the code needs to be in the SAP development environment, in the SAP database. Only there can it do syntax checks. It needs to be activated. After running syntax checks, we need to activate the object and run the ATC checks to make sure performance reviews are done, security checks are done, and naming conventions are followed if the organizations have their own naming standards.

For this very particular reason, we developed a solution called ABAP Accelerator, which takes care of this entire workspace. How exactly ABAP Accelerator works is basically it is an extension to Amazon Q Developer. It is an MCP server-based extension which leverages ADT APIs to do syntax checks, to compile the ABAP code, and to push the code into the SAP system. Whenever we ask Q Developer to write code, let us say in Node.js or in Python, it creates the files in local packages, compiles them, and then we do a git push to the repos. For ABAP development, the code needs to be pushed into the ABAP SAP database. For that, we leverage and use the ADT APIs.

[![Thumbnail 1520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1520)

So why use the ABAP Accelerator? For ABAP development,  specifically for reports or classes, we don't write the entire code in a single program or single SE 38 program. We have multiple includes, tops, data declaration forms where we write the actual business logic. We might have event handling, some classes or some interfaces which we might have developed for event handling, and some RFCs. There are a lot of dependencies among different ABAP objects when it comes to a single application.

What the ABAP accelerator does is crawl through your source code. Let's say you make a query asking to analyze a particular report. It reads the first report, identifies what the dependent custom objects are, and brings those source code as well to understand the entire perspective of what exactly the code does and what exactly that application does, to give you more detailed information. That's why we use the ABAP accelerator.

So let me walk you through the steps on how you're supposed to achieve this and how Q Developer and the ABAP accelerator can help you. Let's assume a scenario where we are doing a migration from ECC to S/4HANA or ECC to cloud native or RISE migrations. The first stage that we do is prepare and plan. It's kind of a reverse engineering where whatever custom objects we might have developed, we would like the AI system to understand what is the core logic, the business logic, and how we can modernize that code. Let's say if you're migrating from on-premises to cloud, the reports won't work in cloud, so we might have to develop a RAP-based application.

[![Thumbnail 1660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1660.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1660)

The RAP-based development is SAP's strategy to have the exact same application which you had on your on-premises system for cloud environments. For that, the development starts from the base CDS layers and goes all the way up to the service layers. It basically helps you to create a Fiori application or an API or data V2 API V4 API quickly. That's why SAP recommends us to switch to RAP-based development. The first stage is prepare and plan, wherein with the help of the ABAP accelerator,  you will ask your developer to analyze a particular report or object. It will analyze the code, give you the core business logic, and create detailed documentation if that's the requirement that you have in the journey. It can also store it on any of the shared workspaces, such as SharePoint or Atlassian Confluence, for storing the documentations.

[![Thumbnail 1690](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1690.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1690)

### Live Demonstration: Migrating ECC Reports to RAP-Based Fiori Applications

After the plan and prepare phase comes the development.  Once we have analyzed all the objects and the entire business logic, we start with development. Now I'll show you a quick demo. It's a little bit technical, just to give you a heads up.  I hope you are able to see the screen clearly. Here, what I'm going to do is ask Q Developer to first analyze this and create a Fiori compatible version of this entire report, whatever it's doing. Does anyone have a question while it loads? That link is an internal link, but in the end, we'll share the QR code which has all the demos and everything for you to go through again. We'll share those details with you. By the way, if you want to get some hands-on experience with Q Developer and with the tools that you see today, then tomorrow there is a builder session that you can experiment with it.

As you can see here, we have this report which we normally write, and as you can see, there are multiple includes in it. The main report doesn't have a lot of code, just start of selection and end of selection.

[![Thumbnail 1840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1840)

My expectation is that Q Developer should crawl through all the includes, understand the program first, and then come up with a cloud migration strategy. This includes determining what artifacts are required, how those need to be created, which objects need to be involved, and which tables they need to refer to. The prompt I provided was to completely analyze the report and help create a RAP-based Fiori application that will perform the same functionality. We don't want to lose the integrity of our core business logic, so we would like to see the same functionality in the modernized version as well. 

[![Thumbnail 1850](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1850.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1850)

[![Thumbnail 1870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1870)

The expectation needs to be clear enough. Creating or writing the source code is not the only thing I'm expecting Q Developer to do.  For example, if you use Jira for project management, Q Developer should be able to create relevant user stories, epics, and tasks for you so that you can easily track all this development on your Jira dashboards. This is what I was talking about with the ABA accelerator. 

[![Thumbnail 1890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1890)

[![Thumbnail 1900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1900)

The tools you see are available in our MCP server. The first tool gets the source code of the main report, and then it reads through it and understands that there are a couple of dependent objects, bringing those as well.  Once it has all the information, it comes up with an analysis first, identifying the core functionality and key features, and then it starts creating the Jira stories. 

[![Thumbnail 1940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1940)

In Q Developer, there are something called rules. What I defined in the rules is that whenever you're creating an object or writing a Jira story, make sure you're documenting everything so that later on if I want to review things, it should be easier for me to track all the things that it did.  As you can see, it's looking for a Confluence page and checking whether a repository and workspace are already available where it can store this documentation. Everything it's doing on its own with very minimal human interaction.

The effectiveness of Q Developer's output does depend on how the program has been developed and whether it follows standards. Sometimes programs may have been created using hardcore coding practices, so Q Developer needs to deal with suboptimal programming. If you want Q Developer to review your code before creating a new one, you can definitely ask it. Whatever knowledge it has comes from all the public spaces, including hardcodings, naming conventions, and text element creations. It takes care of all those things for you.

[![Thumbnail 1960](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/1960.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=1960)

Even if it misses something in the ABA accelerator, we have a tool for ATC checks as well. You can configure your own variant for the ATC check by mentioning what naming convention you follow and what checks you want every time that application goes through whenever you develop an object. You can just ask your developer to run the ATC check using the particular variant you created, and that's it. It does it for you. It not only runs the ATC checks but also rectifies whatever issues are flagged in that execution. It will ask you whether you want it to rectify those or if you're going to do it yourself. It will go back to the source code and make the changes as well. 

Once it provides that kind of analysis, it's probably better for us to review what it is doing and what it has provided, and get comfortable with the output before letting it run the changes. That's a very good point. Whenever it's referring or recommending a tool to make changes or update the source code, it gives you the control whether you want to run it or not. When it asks to update the source code, it waits for you to respond before doing anything.

[![Thumbnail 2100](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2100.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2100)

As you can see, it even came up with a RAP-based structure, including what exactly it needs to create, the parent-child dependency, and the managed with draft scenario.  It started creating the objects, but what it missed was creating certain components.

[![Thumbnail 2120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2120)

[![Thumbnail 2150](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2150.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2150)

[![Thumbnail 2160](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2160.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2160)

[![Thumbnail 2170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2170)

Q Developer created the documentation, but it missed creating the Jira stories. I reminded Q Developer that while it wrote the documentation, I also needed the Jira stories. So I instructed it to create the Jira stories before creating the objects, and it proceeded to do that as well.  In the stories, you can have all the details. If there's a template that you might have created, it will create the stories using those templates for you.  This way, in the story, you can read what it's doing, what it analyzed, and what are the things that it should look for.  Here it clearly identified the project that was already existing. If not, then it creates the project for you as well. As you can see, it started creating the task, the epic, then the story, and the list of tasks that need to be there.  You can review it along the way. If it recognizes something that is hard coded or something that it doesn't recommend, then it will show you and give you the recommendation on how to change it.  You can choose either to adopt it or not. 

[![Thumbnail 2180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2180)

There was another question here.  Regarding interfaces and separate IDs, a couple of years back, Amazon Q Developer actually came in last year. Before that, we had Code Whisperer. Kiro is new. Code Whisperer is gone now. It's now Q Developer, which is integrated with all the different IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, and BAS. There's a BAS extension. We have extensions for various platforms. For .NET, it has out-of-the-box support. For Eva, we have a full extension.

[![Thumbnail 2370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2370)

[![Thumbnail 2380](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2380.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2380)

Q Developer has a setting where you can enable it to analyze your usage matrix and recommend based on continuous usage over two to three months. It understands what your day-to-day interactions are and uses those past interactions as a reference to start giving you recommendations.  That's totally up to you. If you want to disable it, you can disable it. For the Pro tier and Free tier, there are two different tiers for Q Developer. For the Free tier, it's always enabled by default. For the Pro tier, you have the control whether you want to enable it or disable it.  If you keep it enabled and continuously use it for one to two months, then it understands what your day-to-day interactions are and comes up with recommendations accordingly. Then you don't need to give very specific instructions every time.

What we can do is sit together after the session and do a detailed deep dive on all the questions that you have. That works well. You had a lot of interesting questions, so we can definitely meet.

[![Thumbnail 2420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2420)

Once the strategy comes up with the artifacts it needs to create, such as the CDS view, the base views, and the consumption views which sit on top of it, along with the behavior definition, it not only gives you a recommendation.  You will see that it is creating each and every object, doing the syntax checks, activating the objects, and making sure that all the base objects are created properly. There is a lot of dependency when it comes to RAP-based development. If the base objects are not created properly, the follow-up objects will start failing. It understands the significance of each and every step and makes sure that whatever it is creating is working.  Once it creates the base view, it goes a step ahead to create the interface view. I will fast forward this a little bit as it is quite long. 

[![Thumbnail 2470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2470)

The most important aspect I would like to point out is behavior class implementations.  Whenever we do RAP-based development, once we create the serious views, on top of it we create a behavior definition which is aggregated with behavior class implementation. The behavior class contains the actual logic. For example, if you have a custom field in your standard tables, the behavior class defines how those fields need to be updated, if there is a calculation required, or if you need to pull data from some other tables. All of that logic comes in the behavior implementation class. Q Developer not only creates the class for you, but it also generates the actual source code for all of those things.

[![Thumbnail 2510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2510)

[![Thumbnail 2520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2520)

[![Thumbnail 2530](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2530.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2530)

With these theory applications, getting the data is straightforward, but what is important is posting, like creating new records,  updating existing ones, and if you want to delete something, the delete capability to delete the records.  For each and every change that we commit, there needs to be proper authorization being handled.  All those checks are done at the behavior definition level itself. Whatever code it is generating, when it does the syntax checks and activation, it makes sure that the dependent objects are also available before committing to anything.

[![Thumbnail 2550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2550)

Sometimes when it creates the serious view, there is a circular dependency between the objects like parent-child association.  If one is not created, the other one will fail. It understands all of those things. Sometimes, even with reports and regular reports, we need to activate all the objects together. It understands that the objects need to be activated together and it does the job for you. It does everything intuitively for the users.

[![Thumbnail 2590](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2590.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2590)

Once all these artifacts are created and all the code and source code is generated, all we have to do is review it and make sure that it is up to our standards.  If there are any recommended changes that we want to do, we can ask Q Developer to do it, or we can do it on our own. The point here is that it creates a really high quality base boilerplate code which you need to just tweak a little bit  based on your requirements. 

[![Thumbnail 2620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2620)

So here it came with the behavior definition.  Now, here you can see that in the end, it created the service binding and everything for me. What I am trying to do is view this theory application in preview mode just to check what data it is bringing from the tables. When I do that, there is a small logic that is missing in the behavior class implementation. When I was working on this demo, I realized that it missed this piece. To give you context, it missed a logic which was required to be there in the behavior class. Initially when I did the preview mode of the theory application, I could not see any data.

[![Thumbnail 2680](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/dc15b866bb0299a0/2680.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-PVBvjG30&t=2680)

All I had to do was tell Q Developer that when I viewed the application in preview mode, no data was visible, and I know that the table has all the necessary data that I want to view. It clearly understood that in the behavior class implementation, there is an additional logic which it needs to add, and it made the changes for you.  After doing the changes, here is what the final application looks like. The booking tab was empty, so I just told it that this tab is still empty and does not  show any data. Can you please review the code and make sure everything is correct? You could also see that when it created the theory application, it is not just one single screen. We passed through multiple screens.

So it understands the requirement clearly. Yet, it is also missing the create-by-association implementation, so it created everything for you. There is the logic of the source  code and whatever updates it's recommending.  Sometimes what happens is that even when updating the source code, there are instances where Q Developer feels that it's doing a lot of tasks at a single time. So it breaks down the task into smaller ones, finishes the smaller ones, and then in the end, it consolidates  everything and brings you with the final application.  They got the source code here.  There are some errors. All I have to do was just tell it that the object still has some errors and make sure you're updating it properly. Go back to the preview mode. And there you go.  It brings you all the flight data, the different information, the booking details, and you can even do the edit, like I said, the PUT operations and all. 

### Development Efficiency Gains and Resources for Getting Started with Q Developer

Once everything is done and all the artifacts are created, it automatically goes to the Jira stories, updates them, and makes sure that your development loop is completed altogether, with nothing left behind. You had a question? No, okay, yes, go ahead. I'm confused about how this relates to the Jira stories. What, why? That's just for better development tracking. Whatever artifacts that you're creating, it's not required, but just say you're using Jira stories for your project development or product development, right? We just wanted to show that Q Developer can create those stories for you as well and help ease your development life cycle. Take a look at your story and do it, then update. Is that okay? Yeah, absolutely.

So whether you want one single developer to do it or whether you want different developers to do it, that will be up to the development team altogether. But what we wanted to show over here is that normally for this kind of development, right, it takes about one day. Like without any AI coding assistance, creating the stories, writing the stories, writing the documentation, and creating the final RAP application. And that's when the person is aware of how RAP applications are developed, what the existing source code is doing, and what the legacy object is doing. So when they have all this information, they can do everything in one day.

But what we want to show over here is how you can shorten that development time span with Q Developer. Now, the same person with the help of Q Developer can achieve this task. So I did this in one hour actually. Within an hour, I created the documentation, created the RAP Fiori application, created Jira stories, closed the loop, and did the unit testing. So even in the SAP world, right, we have test-driven development where we create local unit test classes for checking the functionality of our source code. So it also creates the unit test for you, runs them, and verifies the business logic and everything. And all this I was able to do in an hour. So we just want to show how it accelerates your ABAP development, whenever you're doing a migration or even with your day-to-day maintenance activities.

There's a lot of meetings. True. So that is possible. Definitely that is possible, but not with this solution. This is purely for development. So for that, there is another solution that might be required, which takes care of the functional aspect of SAP development. So it can make the old data calls, get the data, limited based on how many records you want to see. So it can do that as well with Q Developer. All we have to do is just configure those MCP servers, and that's about it. So you have to set up if you have a legacy system, how do you then serve. Sorry, sorry, I could.  What do you have to do? Like you have all these MCP, right? So how do you set it up? What do you have to do to the existing?

The MCP server is configured the same way you configure ADT on your Eclipse, where you provide the host URL and your logon credentials. It uses your username to create all these artifacts, so it won't do it on its own. Whatever logon details you have when you configure your recipe system in Eclipse with the ADT, you need to provide those same configuration details to Q Developer. There is a workshop tomorrow, I think, where you will see how you can configure these MCP servers and everything. It's a hands-on workshop, and I recommend you attend it. It will answer a lot of your questions.

After the transformation, the next step is the technical unit testing.  As I mentioned, it creates a locally implemented unit test class or a completely different unit test class for you based on your standards.  With that, I hand it over back to Shirley.

I just wanted to invite you to scan those barcodes. In the first one, you can see videos of our multiple demos that we have for Q Developer, including the Fiori applications and the MCP server that was just demonstrated and all the capabilities that Q Developer can do. I highly recommend it. You have the app accelerator that we just saw. You can see the pricing and you can also see the blog. The blog is very explanatory both on how to install it and how to use it and the benefits that it can bring to your customers and to your company from different various life cycle professions, for example, functional consultants, testing, QA, and also developers, of course, front end and back end.
