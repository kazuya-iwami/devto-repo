### Bridging the Gap: IBM watsonx Orchestrate as a Solution to Agent Sprawl

 Good afternoon, folks. Hope everybody's doing fine. So what we'll do is, as all of you know, it's an exciting time to be in tech. There is a significant expectation from AI to give productivity in our day-to-day work.  On the right, you see that by the next three years, 15 to 20% of our day-to-day work is to be done by agentic AI, but the reality is on the left. Every day in an enterprise, at an average employee or overall enterprise level, there are 1,000 applications that employees use to get their work done. How do we bridge the gap between the complexity and the promise of productivity?

[![Thumbnail 50](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/50.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=50)

That's where IBM has IBM watsonx Orchestrate. It's an open and governed interoperable platform for agents  targeted for business users. Agent sprawl is real. Every ERP vendor, every hyperscaler, as you see around, are building agents for business users, and abstracting this complexity is very important. Orchestrate plays a role in that simplification of this agentic estate for an end user.

On the left, you see that Orchestrate supports agents coming from anywhere. You can build natively. You can bring agents built in an open-source platform. You can connect agents running on a third-party platform. And we have prebuilt agents for specific domains built by IBM. And you also have traditional business automation tools like robotic process automation or business automation workflows that companies have already invested in, and they can connect into the orchestration engine through MCP.

So that's on your left. And you have an end-to-end management layer at the bottom, which essentially allows you to govern and monitor these agents that are built anywhere else but running in Orchestrate. And we have the unified experience layer for end users to abstract away this complexity. All they have to care about is what is the goal that they want to achieve, and the orchestration actually delegates the task to every agent, whether they are built natively or they are built anywhere else, or it could be traditional automations, especially for the things that you want a fixed set of actions to be taken by the agents.

Over the next 17 to 18 minutes, what we'll go through is we'll take a use case, a complex use case in an enterprise setup, and show how agents that are built natively and elsewhere can orchestrate and fulfill that goal of end users. I have Jyotsna taking over.

### Transforming Sam's Workday: A Live Demo of Multi-Agent Orchestration in Order Fulfillment

Thank you, Sampath. Hi, everyone. So let's look over the shoulder of Sam, our persona, who is an order fulfillment manager. This is the day in her life. Her primary job is to make sure  she receives the orders and ensures they're delivered on time. So she goes to Sterling OMS, which is our order management system, to look at the status of the orders. And if there is any supplier information that she requires or has to create purchase requisitions, she goes to a procurement system like Coupa or SAP.

And to see if there are any tickets raised by her customers, she goes to Salesforce, ServiceNow, those sorts of systems. And she works in heavy industry, so to make sure all of her shipping is on time and is not disrupted due to weather, she of course has to check the weather information. And she goes to Google or news outlets to make sure that the global supply chain policies have not changed. And then she does a lot of analysis by pulling information over to Excel and does manipulations. And finally, if she's stuck anywhere or needs help, there's really not much place that she goes to.

[![Thumbnail 240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/240.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=240)

So now we want to show how her life can be transformed when IBM watsonx Orchestrate and Agent  Core comes together to really transform her experience through a conversational AI. So all she has to do as somebody who's new to the organization and who might not be familiar with all of the different backend applications and the nuances and answers to it, she can interact with Orchestrate through the natural language query so that it understands her intents, routes it to the various agents that it has at its disposal, triggers the right tools, and helps her accomplish her task.

[![Thumbnail 280](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/280.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=280)

[![Thumbnail 300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=300)

So upcoming I have a recorded demo that's embedded. I'll talk through it, but you can watch her experience on the screen. So this is the Orchestrate chat experience.  It comes with the builder tool, observability tool, all under one unified platform. So she starts her day with showing her the orders for Steelix, her primary account. Orchestrate understands the intent and pulls together a series of tools, chains them to accomplish the outcome,  and surfaces that outcome back to her in a readable format.

[![Thumbnail 310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=310)

[![Thumbnail 320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=320)

So first things first, all of her interactions are registered through the Agent Core Memory Services.  Now this, as you heard Swami this morning, really helps in personalizing her experience as these memories get saved over a period of time, and you could also enable analytics  on it like how are the suppliers, where are the delays, how are my orders doing and so on and so forth over a period of time.

[![Thumbnail 330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=330)

[![Thumbnail 340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=340)

[![Thumbnail 350](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/350.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=350)

[![Thumbnail 360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=360)

Now the agent was able to  invoke the Sterling OMS tools where the order information is stored and render it back to her in a consumable fashion so she understands her orders at a glance.  It also provides a narrative on what are the orders that are actually in blocked status and what are the impacts due to it. Now she  can also double click on certain orders to understand more. Now this order specifically she got a query about, so it has to go on time. So now she understands it's  backordered and also it's a Platinum customer, so she can't afford any sort of gotchas here.

[![Thumbnail 370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=370)

[![Thumbnail 380](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/380.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=380)

[![Thumbnail 390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=390)

[![Thumbnail 400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=400)

The agent provides a root cause analysis  on why the order is blocked and also provides her with strategies on how to fulfill these orders. So there are a number of strategies that are laid out  here from reallocating inventory from a lower tier to Platinum or finding an alternate sourcing. So in this case she picks alternate sourcing.  So she creates this complex query to search the catalog for a certain item, find the suppliers who can provide that item, and also find the cheapest supplier amongst  them, and go ahead and create the purchase requisition.

[![Thumbnail 410](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/410.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=410)

[![Thumbnail 420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=420)

[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=430)

[![Thumbnail 440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=440)

Orchestrate has the Coupa agents. I'll ask its collaborators, as I mentioned,  it can collaborate across multiple agents. So now it understands this is not something for the Sterling OMS agent, but for the procurement agent and routes it to that  in order to fulfill her ask. It breaks it down into multiple tasks and accomplishes them in a sequence. It also identifies that she's missing a few information. Okay, you asked  me to create a requisition, but for how many items? So it has that multi-turn conversation with Sam to guide  her through the process to get the missing information and then go ahead and create the purchase requisition.

[![Thumbnail 450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/450.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=450)

[![Thumbnail 460](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/460.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=460)

[![Thumbnail 470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=470)

It also provides her the rationale of why it selected Supplier 2,  because you asked me for the cheapest supplier, and then all of the information in a consolidated manner. Again, shipping information  is missing so it comes back and asks for that information. Next, once all of the purchase requisition is completed, it now asks her the next step in the process is to go ahead  and submit.

[![Thumbnail 480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=480)

[![Thumbnail 490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=490)

[![Thumbnail 510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=510)

The other key pieces, as you can imagine, Coupa and there is another system, Sterling OMS, which does not have an integration  between them, but because they both are collaborating agents on Orchestrate, Orchestrate provides that soft bridge integration so that  organizations don't have to spend the time and effort integrating all of these systems yourself. Now she was able to take the purchase requisition from Coupa and then sync it back to Sterling OMS or to the ServiceNow, whatever systems of record that's required with the required information.  So this is Coupa in the back end where the purchase requisition is actually created by the trigger from Orchestrate.

[![Thumbnail 520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=520)

[![Thumbnail 530](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/530.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=530)

[![Thumbnail 540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=540)

[![Thumbnail 550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=550)

Now because all of this information has been recorded using Agent  Core Memory Services, she can retrieve it back both in this chat interface as well as in a different thread  and continue the conversation from then on, so it really helps to store that long-term memory so she can pick that conversation back up on a different day or in a different thread. Now she wants to make sure she did the right things,  so she's asking the agent to summarize what she did and send it as an email to her manager so her manager can be rest assured that Sam, a new  employee, followed the procedures and the policies that are required within the organization.

[![Thumbnail 560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/560.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=560)

### Behind the Scenes: Builder Experience, Integration Capabilities, and the Path to Autonomous AI Agents

Now let's take a quick look at behind the scenes on what happens.  So this is the catalog of Orchestrate, the primary landing page for builders, and we have around 200 pre-built domain agents across different domains and to different applications. I mentioned about the IBM systems, but we also have ServiceNow, Oracle, Workday. Depending on what your starting point use case is, you can come here to pick the agent and then explore the agent that you need, and with a click as user's template, you can take it back to your builder experience.  Within the builder experience, you have full control to customize your agent because we understand every organization is unique.

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=600)

Pre-built agents could take you to 30  to 40 percent of your use case, but then the controls are in your hand. You can pick and choose the model of your choice.

[![Thumbnail 610](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/610.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=610)

[![Thumbnail 620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=620)

[![Thumbnail 630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=630)

In this case, we have integrated with the Bedrock  models, so we are using the Claude Sonnet 3.5 from Bedrock. I can add additional tools, I can add additional agents, and  I also have the control to add instructions through the simple no-code experience to make sure that the agent behaves in the way that I wanted it to behave. 

We saw Sam interacting with the agent through the Orchestrate chat experience, but this can also be embedded within the channel of her choice. If Sam is always on Teams or Slack, then this agent can also be integrated there, so it provides that easy access for her. Any tools we can consume, we can add tools here from MCP server, or we can also create our own tools through Python and add it to the agent builder experience.

As I mentioned about the collaboration, orchestration is key for any business use case that we have out there. We know it's not just one task, it's a series of tasks that needs to be accomplished. The more and more you're able to orchestrate, the more time and effort that you're actually able to save. We are able to add agents that are natively built on Orchestrate or are built elsewhere and bring them back through the A2A protocol or the chat completions API. This preview on the side gives the builder an easy experience to test and make sure that the agent behaves the way it intends to behave.

We have a unified connection manager which allows the builder to give authentication security connections to all of the backend tools that Sam is supposed to have, like the Sterling OMS connections or the Coupa connections, which are seamless behind the scenes. The agent is able to hop across these different collaborating agents to accomplish the tasks.

[![Thumbnail 730](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/730.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=730)

Now moving on, what did we see? We brought together IBM's orchestration engine along with the agent core  services in order to bring a real-life use case to life. As a fulfillment team, the IBM Watson Orchestrate has two types of personas: the business users who are able to, with little technical expertise, build their own agents through the no-code agent builder, and of course the developers. We have an agent development kit through which they're able to build pro-code agents and then make them available on the UI experience as well.

There's any channel of engagement, as we saw, and then a series of agents from the catalog or from the external agents that are built elsewhere or natively built on Orchestrate can all be put together through our orchestration engine. Orchestrate runs on AWS. We are available on AWS Marketplace and use all of the services that are available. Also, now we are able to leverage the agent core services. We showed memory, we showed the Bedrock models, and we are able to do the same thing with observability and really provide that one unified experience to understand how are your agents running, where are the errors, how many failures, what are the tools that were invoked, were there any tool hallucinations that happened, how many tokens were exchanged. All of them can also be monitored on Orchestrate's inbuilt analytics dashboard.

The benefits, as I mentioned, the way these agents can be brought together is really up to the creativity of the end user. It provides that proactive intelligence. The next time I log in, if it knows Steelix is my primary account, it can surface up and say, hey, here are the orders from Steelix, and then can provide real-time insights. I didn't show it here, but imagine having a weather tool which says, okay, your shipment node is coming from city one where at this time of the year there are a lot of weather disruptions, so you might want to choose an alternate sourcing route through a different city. It's able to now provide you that level of recommendations without me having to go do those lookups.

I spoke about the multi-agent collaboration. We saw what it could do by bringing in two disparate systems like Sterling and Coupa and SAP onto a unified platform. Then the observability, we were not able to go deeper into it, but in the platform we have the analytics dashboard which provides a unified observability. We are soon adding observability even for third-party agents because that's been the biggest challenge. Now I have observability on my native agents, how do I know what's happening on the third party? You're able to bring all of them on a unified experience, and then the memory is able to provide you with preferences and analytics based on the past experience.

[![Thumbnail 950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/53b7ef9611e1b6cb/950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEex9rRKjw&t=950)

I really wanted to close with this slide. Where we are, what's available today are the AI assistants. We are all using copilots in different capacities now. Where we are working  right now is in these high-impact workflows which really provide the lift on productivity and become AI agents become part of your everyday business use case, be it sales, procurement, talent, finance, support, HR, and so on and so forth. These are the starting point use cases that we have as part of our catalog. This really becomes that stepping stone for that next level, which is really the frontier for fully autonomous AI agents to play in  because there are a lot of issues and problems to solve from trust and reliability, and you must have heard a lot about it this week. That truly unlocks and enables really small teams to be able to do high-impactful work.
