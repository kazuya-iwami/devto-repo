### Introduction to NET313: Unveiling AWS Network Encryption and VPC Encryption Controls

 Good afternoon everybody and welcome to NET313. We'll be talking about some encryption in transit today.  My name is Scott Morrison. I'm a networking SA here at AWS. This will be my 5th re:Invent that I've presented at and my 7th year at AWS. After 7 years at AWS, I've gotten to know a lot about how our network operates under the hood, where all the packets are going through our network, and what's happening to them. It's lost a little bit of the mystery after 7 years, but then I come to re:Invent. I get to meet with all of our great customers and see the mystery that still happens with how the network works at AWS.

Today we're going to unwrap a little bit of that mystery for you, talk about how some of that encryption works at AWS on our network, and some great new features related to VPC encryption controls. With that, I'm going to bring on my peer and product manager for VPC, Akshay Choudhry, to take it over and talk a little bit about VPC encryption controls, and then I'll be back with you here in a few minutes to talk more about encryption.

[![Thumbnail 90](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/90.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=90)

Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Akshay Choudhry. I lead the product management team here at AWS for VPC. Here I'll first introduce encryption.  I'll talk about what encryption is, how you implement it, and how it has evolved over time. Then I'll talk about the challenges in implementing encryption. With that, I'll talk about how AWS is solving many of those challenges by offering native encryption across multiple network paths. After that, I'll introduce this new feature of VPC encryption controls. We launched it two weeks ago.

This feature helps you monitor the encryption status of your traffic flows, and it also helps you identify workloads that are not enforcing encryption. It offers you tools to enforce encryption in transit across your environment in a region. A lot has gone into building this feature, and we would love for you folks to go back and try your hand at this feature and give us feedback. One thing that is common across all the successful features at AWS is that we got a lot of feedback from our customers about what they expect from these features. Then we kept working on that feedback and improved it over time, and we would really appreciate your support in doing the same with VPC encryption controls.

### The Evolution of Encryption: From Caesar Cipher to Modern Key Management Challenges

After I've discussed the details of how to set up VPC encryption controls and what it does, I'll hand over the stage to my co-presenter, Scott, who will discuss encryption strategies and the emerging encryption frontiers.  So with that, encryption—what is encryption?  Encryption is the process by which you protect your data from getting snooped on or from getting compromised by scrambling it using some logic. In this example, suppose the sender wants to send a simple text: "Welcome to re:Invent." What they would do is use some logic to scramble it with the expectation that only the intended receiver can unscramble it and look at the original message. This way, someone who's not intended to see this message will never see the original text.

[![Thumbnail 220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=220)

 Encryption has been known to exist since 100 BC. Back then it was used for secure communications between military factions and was called Caesar cipher. It used to be pretty simple back then, consisting of some alphabetic substitutions. With time, the attackers got more sophisticated and knew how to decipher the simple encryption. With that, the encryption also evolved to make it more difficult for any attackers to decipher it. We have evidence that around the 15th century, encryption consisted of polyalphabetic substitutions.

Then in World War II, Germany came out with the Enigma machine to encrypt all their communication. Back then it was considered unbreakable until Alan Turing developed a machine to decipher those or to break that encryption. That machine was the first computer that led to the invention of the first computer. But until then there was no one set standard worldwide for encryption. In 1977, there were encryption standards that were used worldwide: DES, which is Digital Encryption Standard, and RSA.

Today, the most prominently used encryption standard is Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES. It comes with different key lengths, which we'll discuss later. Post-quantum cryptography is also picking up, and Scott will talk more about it. Post-quantum cryptography is considered to be safe even from attackers who use quantum computers to break it.

With that, let's look at how encryption works. We are looking at an example where the sender wants to send the simple text "welcome to reinvent." Before sending this message, the sender uses a cryptographic mathematical model to derive a key, which they use to encrypt or scramble this text. Once they've scrambled it, they use the same mathematical model to derive another complementary key that can be used to unscramble or decrypt it. Let's call that the receiver key. Once they have that complementary key, they find a way to securely transmit that key to the receiver. When the receiver receives the key, they are able to decrypt the traffic and see the original message.

Now, when the sender key and the receiver key are different, it's called asymmetric encryption, and when they're the same, it's called symmetric encryption. Worldwide, the most common encryption standard uses symmetric encryption today. You may have noticed two things here. First, it takes some computational power both on the sender side and the receiver's side to encrypt and decrypt the traffic. Along with that, the security of the key is of paramount importance because if this key gets into the hands of an attacker, they will have visibility into the entire communication between the sender and the receiver.

That's why companies spend large amounts of resources to build infrastructure that can keep these keys secure and rotate them regularly so that in case of a compromise, the blast radius is limited. AWS recognized the challenges in implementing encryption and building secure key management systems long ago, and we started offering native encryption across multiple paths. Next, we'll discuss the native encryption that AWS offers across different paths.

### AWS Native Encryption Across Data Centers and the Launch of VPC Encryption Controls

Today, all traffic between any two AWS data centers is encrypted using state-of-the-art Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key whenever this traffic leaves AWS secured facilities. This encryption is implemented between data centers in an availability zone, across availability zones, and even across regions. When traffic is transmitted between regions using transit gateway peering or cross-region peering, it gets an additional layer of bulk encryption on top of the native AES 256 encryption.

You may have noticed that I've been saying this traffic is encrypted when it leaves AWS secured facilities. These facilities are really secure because there's physical security present there and no unauthorized person can just walk into these buildings. But there's no such thing as too much security. Back in 2019, we launched Nitro Encryption, or VPC Encryption. Today, any two modern EC2 instances when they're communicating with each other have all the traffic between these instances encrypted using state-of-the-art AES 256 encryption. This encryption holds true even within AWS data centers and even within AWS secured facilities.

I still remember back in 2019 when we launched Nitro Encryption. Back then, there were hordes of customers who upgraded their entire infrastructure so they could use this native Nitro Encryption. The good thing about this Nitro Encryption is that it's transparent to the customer. You don't have to manage the key infrastructure. It does not impact the compute power or the processing power of your EC2 instances, and it just works transparently. So even today, a lot of customers

still face challenges. Today, many customers manage Excel workbooks to track the usage of instance types across their environment. However, tracking this manually presents several challenges. First, it requires manual effort to track instance usage across your environment. Second, native Nitro encryption works on modern EC2 instances, but EC2 instances also communicate with AWS services or external services, not all of which support Nitro encryption. Third, as you introduce new workloads, the number of potential network paths increases exponentially, making it difficult to track and monitor encryption across all these paths.

[![Thumbnail 670](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/670.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=670)

[![Thumbnail 680](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/680.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=680)

That's why AWS launched VPC Encryption Controls  to address these challenges. VPC Encryption Controls comes in two modes: monitor mode and enforce mode.  It allows you to monitor the encryption status of your traffic flows and identify resources that are not enforcing encryption in transit. It also gives you the tools to enforce encryption in transit within your VPC and across your VPCs. Once you have done that, you can create and generate flow logs for auditing purposes, or you can look at which VPCs are enforcing encryption and which are not.

[![Thumbnail 720](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=720)

This feature is easy to use.  You can literally click a single button to turn on encryption controls in your existing VPCs or new VPCs. You can turn it on during creation itself. Additionally, it addresses another challenge by offering native Nitro encryption beyond EC2 instances to many AWS services like RDS, Redshift, Application Load Balancer, and Fargate tasks. It also works across your VPCs when you're using VPC peering or Transit Gateway. You can exert all these controls centrally, create reports, and demonstrate compliance with different encryption standards.

[![Thumbnail 770](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/770.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=770)

### Monitor Mode: Identifying Non-Compliant Resources with VPC Flow Logs

Let's talk about the different modes of encryption controls.  As I mentioned, there are two modes: monitor mode and enforce mode. We will discuss monitor mode before enforce mode because you cannot directly move an existing VPC to enforce mode. Enforce mode ensures that all your existing resources are enforcing encryption in transit and that all future resources you launch in your VPC will also enforce encryption in transit. However, to ensure encryption in transit for existing resources, you first need to identify which resources are not enforcing encryption today, and for that you need to turn on monitor mode first.

[![Thumbnail 830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=830)

Turning on monitor mode is straightforward.  You simply select your VPC and turn on encryption controls. You'll notice that the enforce mode is grayed out for existing VPCs because you first need to make sure that all your resources are encrypting traffic at the resource level. This applies only to existing VPCs. If you're creating a new VPC, you can immediately turn on encryption enforcement because you don't have any resources there yet. Once you turn on monitor mode, we provide you with a new control that allows you to identify resources that may not be enforcing encryption.

[![Thumbnail 870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=870)

You can go into the VPC Encryption Controls console  and see which resources are not encrypting or not enforcing encryption today. You can also use the CLI to identify those resources. When you look at the screen, you will find not only the resources that are not enforcing encryption but also whether these resources are eligible for exclusion. We'll discuss later in the slides how you can exclude certain resources.

[![Thumbnail 950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=950)

Exclusion allows you to exclude certain resources from encryption enforcement. By exclusion, we mean that there are certain resources, for example, an Internet gateway or virtual private gateway, through which your traffic transmits outside the boundary of AWS. For such resources, you are responsible for enforcing encryption. You can either remove those resources from the VPC or continue running them as exclusions. When you continue running them as exclusions and still go into enforce mode, AWS will ensure that all future resources or all existing resources except these excluded resources will enforce encryption. For these excluded resources, you are responsible for maintaining encryption. 

[![Thumbnail 980](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/980.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=980)

This is what exclusion does. Once you identify these resources, we will discuss how to migrate each of these resources and ensure that they are enforcing encryption. Before we go there, the monitor mode also gives you the ability to monitor the encryption status of individual traffic flows using your familiar VPC Flow Logs. When you turn on VPC Flow Logs, we have introduced a new field called encryption status. 

[![Thumbnail 1010](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1010.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1010)

You can turn on encryption status, and it will start emitting numerical values to tell you whether your traffic is encrypted, whether it is encrypted at the application layer, or whether it is encrypted at the physical layer using Nitro encryption. This is how you can read the encryption status. 

When the encryption status is 0, it means that the VPC encryption controls has recognized your traffic flow as unencrypted. Please note that VPC encryption controls recognizes Nitro encryption at the physical layer as well as application layer encryption only to AWS services via AWS PrivateLink interface endpoints and gateway endpoints. When it emits a value of 1, it means that your traffic is encrypted at the physical layer using the Nitro system hardware. A value of 2 means it is encrypted at the application layer. You will see the value 2 when your traffic is going to or coming from AWS services accessed via gateway endpoints or interface endpoints.

The numerical value 3 tells you that the traffic is encrypted both at the physical layer by Nitro and at the application layer. If you do not get any value, it means that either you have not turned on VPC encryption controls or VPC Flow Logs currently does not have that value. This is how you monitor the encryption status and identify the sources which are not enforcing encryption.

[![Thumbnail 1120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1120)

### Transitioning to Enforce Mode: Ensuring Encryption Within and Across VPCs

Next, let's see how you can turn on or transition your existing VPC to enforce mode.  To repeat, if you have a new VPC, you can turn on enforce mode at creation itself. But for existing VPCs, you first need to turn on monitor mode and identify the non-compliant resources. The non-compliant resources are the resources that are not enforcing encryption in transit. 

Once you have done that, the next step is to make certain changes to these resources and ensure that all of them are enforcing encryption. For many of the resources, we will take care of encryption ourselves once you turn on the encryption controls even in monitor mode. Then, once you have made sure that all your resources, especially the non-excludable ones, are enforcing encryption in transit, that is when you can modify your encryption controls to turn on enforce mode or transition to enforce mode.

Let's look at how you can ensure that your different VPC resources are enforcing encryption. For many of the resources such as Fargate tasks, Application Load Balancer, and Network Load Balancer, the moment you turn on encryption controls in monitor mode itself, behind the scenes we will start migrating these resources onto new Nitro hardware so that they can automatically and natively support encryption in transit. You do not have to do anything. Once you turn it on, we will take care of it. It will take some time, but we will do it.

[![Thumbnail 1230](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1230.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1230)

For all AWS services except API Gateway, for all AWS services that are supported by PrivateLink interface endpoints or gateway endpoints, we'll enforce encryption at the application layer. This means that if an application tries to send unencrypted traffic to such AWS services, we'll drop it. Then there are a host of other services.  These services include your EC2, auto scaling groups, EKS, ECS, and others. Here, you typically select the underlying instance type, so you are responsible for choosing modern instances. For many customers we've talked to, they're already using modern instances for these resources, and if you're doing that, you're all set.

But in case you're using an older generation instance, you need to move those resources onto new hardware or modern EC2 instances. Once you do that, they will also start encrypting traffic at the physical layer. All these resources lie inside your VPC and they help you enforce encryption within the VPC itself. Now, let's talk about what you need to do if you have a transit gateway and you also want to encrypt your traffic across VPCs. For transit gateway, we have introduced a new option called encryption support, and you can turn it to enable.

[![Thumbnail 1320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1320.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1320)

[![Thumbnail 1340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1340)

Once you turn it to enable, even your traffic between your VPCs that have encryption enforced will start getting encrypted at the physical layer itself. Once you've moved all these resources to encryption enforcement, you can then transition to enforce mode.  While you're transitioning to enforce mode, the console will give you the list of resources that are unencrypted and will also give you the list of resources that are eligible for exclusion. You can turn on exclusion  for those resources, and then you can turn on enforce mode.

Once you turn on enforce mode, the VPC does two things. One, it makes sure that your existing resources always communicate in encrypted traffic. The second thing it does is make sure that any future resources you instantiate inside this VPC are always enforcing encryption. It won't allow you to launch older generation EC2 instances which do not support encryption. That is what enforce mode does.

[![Thumbnail 1390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1390)

[![Thumbnail 1400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1400)

After turning on enforce mode, this allows you to enforce encryption within the VPC. But next we'll discuss how you can ensure encryption across VPCs using VPC peering and transit gateway.  Whenever you're using VPC peering, suppose you have two VPCs and both those VPCs have  encryption controls turned on in enforce mode without any exclusion. You can pair these VPCs, and all communication between these VPCs will always be encrypted.

However, even if one of those VPCs has any exclusions or if one of those VPCs has encryption controls turned on in monitor mode or is turned off, then in order to turn on peering with an encryption enforced VPC, you need to create an exclusion for that peering. What that means is that this VPC, the VPC on the left hand side, is going to encrypt all traffic except the traffic that's going to the peering connection. The traffic going to the peering connection, the encryption status of that traffic would depend on the resources that are communicating with each other.

For example, if you have modern EC2 instances on both sides or you have services running on top of modern EC2 instances, then this traffic will be encrypted. But in case this resource tries to communicate with another resource running on an older generation EC2 instance, then the traffic won't be encrypted. This is how you can turn on encryption between your encryption enforced VPCs. But if you want more flexibility here, for example, if you want this VPC which is encryption enforced to be connected to a different VPC which is not encryption enforced and still make sure that all traffic within this VPC is encrypted, that's when you need to use transit gateway.

[![Thumbnail 1510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1510)

This is what happens  when you use transit gateway. You can turn on encryption controls on your transit gateway. When you enable encryption controls on your transit gateway and you peer to VPCs, you can pair a VPC that has encryption controls running without enforce mode and without any exclusion, and you can pair it with a VPC which is not encryption enforced. The solid line here represents the encrypted traffic and the broken line represents the traffic that may or may not be encrypted.

In this case, within the VPC which is encryption enforced, all your traffic will be encrypted, even the traffic that's going to the transit gateway. The traffic is encrypted through the transit gateway attachment in your encryption unenforced VPC, and only the last leg of the traffic, which is between the transit gateway attachment and your resource in the unenforced encryption VPC, will depend on the resource type that the transit gateway is communicating with. This is how you can use this new feature, VPC encryption controls, to enforce encryption within your VPCs and across your VPCs.

### Encryption Strategies: Layering Protocols from MACsec to TLS Across the OSI Model

Next, I'll hand it over to Scott who will discuss the different encryption strategies and emerging encryption frontiers. Thanks, Akshay. Let's talk about encryption strategies.  We've all seen, or hopefully most of us have seen the famous Werner Vogels shirt that Akshay and I are wearing today: encrypt everything, right? But encrypt everything is a goal, it's not a strategy. So how do we actually get to that goal? Encryption layering is the answer to this.

[![Thumbnail 1630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1630)

 Interestingly, you can match encryption layering to the OSI model. If you're not familiar with the OSI model, it gives us seven layers of networking, from physical all the way to application. These different protocols work at different layers. We have optical line encryption or MACsec encryption between our AWS secured facilities like Akshay was talking about earlier. This exists without you having to do anything. You can also use MACsec encryption on your Direct Connect connections if you have a supported connection. You can check this in your direct connections and enable it.

Then we can move up the stack into the network layer, that layer three IP layer, and we get into AWS Nitro encryption, which we can enforce using encryption controls and using modern instances. We also get some tunneling technology like IPSec, WireGuard, and OpenVPN. You can find IPSec and OpenVPN in AWS Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Client VPN. You can use these to encrypt between on-premises locations, various end user locations, and your AWS VPC.

Then we get TLS. TLS is really great and really performant. It encrypts in that layer four through six area. This is supported through your customer applications, Amazon VPC Lattice, if you're not familiar with it there are some great sessions this week, Elastic Load Balancer, CloudFront, and many more services support TLS. Then we get into application level encryption, things like SSH that exist out there, client side encryption, you may use something like our Key Management Service, KMS, to do that. There are a lot of different ways to do that, but it really moves up the stack and using multiple layers is going to help you make sure that all of your traffic is encrypted, that you're really encrypting everything.

[![Thumbnail 1770](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/ef080d61263809f5/1770.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KISi6OjXla8&t=1770)

 So let's look at the characteristics of these different encryption protocols. We have MACsec at the data link layer. Performance is really high. Typically this is implemented in hardware with hardware acceleration, ASICs or FPGAs that are doing the encryption at line rate. It's a hop by hop encryption though, which means that between every two layer two devices, that's where the encryption stops, gets decrypted, and then re-encrypted. So thinking of Direct Connect between your on-premises router and the Direct Connect switch, it's going to be encrypted.

When the switch encrypts the data, it gets decrypted on the AWS switch, and then when we leave an AWS secured facility, we encrypt again with optical line encryption or MACsec encryption. This is that hop-by-hop characteristic that the networking team typically manages. Then we get into IPSec. IPSec tends to be a little less performant depending on where you're terminating it. If you have hardware acceleration, that's great. One of the downsides to IPSec is that it's an encapsulation protocol, which means you're cutting off the maximum transmission unit, or MTU. Over the internet or even over Direct Connect with a site-to-site VPN, you're going to see an MTU somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,433 bytes, maybe a little less or a little more depending on what you're doing. That's going to be less, which means when we start getting into higher latency environments, your performance is going to go down. You have to really think about that usage, but you can get some very performant connections as well. We actually just released up to 5 gigabit per second tunnels on AWS Site-to-Site VPN, which is really cool. I've been seeing the team work on this for a number of years. This is a point-to-point connection, meaning that where you terminate the IPSec tunnel on each side is where it's going to go. It's spanning multiple hops, but it's not end-to-end. It's not from server to server necessarily, though it could be.

Then we get into Nitro encryption. The security team can now control this using VPC encryption controls. By setting those VPC encryption controls, we've taken things from the networking team and given some capability to the security team to enforce encryption. This is again point-to-point. It's going to be from an AWS EC2 instance to an AWS EC2 instance. If there are multiple hops in there like a Transit Gateway, there will be some points where it decrypts and re-encrypts. TLS is super performant because every individual session gets encrypted with a different key and gets hashed against multiple processing cores. It's an absolutely performing protocol. Honestly, most things today should be using TLS. Most of your applications should use it, but it's hard to manage and hard to enforce because it's typically on the application owner to enforce this. You really have to think through how you enforce this and how you audit it.

That's where multi-layer encryption comes into play. The networking team has an enforcement point, the security team has an enforcement point, and the application owner has an enforcement point. Everybody gets a piece of the pie to make sure that we're fully encrypted. Then there's application-layer encryption, which tends to be something like encrypting individual packets with something like KMS. It's really hard to implement this in a performant way. If you want to be really super secure and try to do it, you definitely can, but for most things in transit, TLS, Nitro, some type of tunneling protocol, MACsec, and optical line encryption is where you're going to get the most bang for your buck compared to client-side encryption. KMS is better for encryption at rest than encryption in transit.

### Emerging Frontiers: Post-Quantum Cryptography, ML-KEM, and the Path to Encrypt Everything

Let's talk about emerging encryption frontiers. We've come a long way, and we're now getting into post-quantum cryptography. Everyone sees this and thinks it's this magical thing. Quantum is all magic, right? No one really knows what it means. Of course, quantum cryptography is all about the fact that in theory there may be some future where a quantum computer could potentially break RSA or elliptical curve. There's not one that we know of in existence today that's done it. They haven't reached enough entanglement to be able to do that or enough qubits. But we think that maybe there's some future where that could exist. Before we get to that future, the industry as a whole has been studying how we make encryption safe so that if someone's storing those packets, they can't go decrypt them later. For most people, this is not really a concern because your data is probably not worth enough to store all that data forever. For some people, it's very important. Governments, financial services, and other entities really care about this. It just depends on what you're doing, but it's one of those things that we're starting to think about. AWS has started taking it really seriously, and we've started releasing services that support ML-KEM, which stands for Module-Lattice-based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism. It's a mouthful.

To explain what that mechanism is, we do a key exchange using asymmetric encryption to perform that key exchange with RSA or elliptical curve, typically using Diffie-Hellman within that asymmetric path. Once we do that key exchange, we get symmetric keys on both sides, and we use those symmetric keys as a performant way to encrypt the data that's actually going across it. So we use asymmetric encryption to exchange symmetric keys and then symmetric encryption to actually transport data, which is AES.

We believe AES is quantum safe, especially 256-bit and 128-bit. NIST has shown some data indicating it could be quantum safe. However, RSA and elliptical curve is where the real concern is, and with perfect forward secrecy, AES is even less of a concern. We have different sessions in there, so we focus on ML-KEM within our services and how we do that key exchange. We support it within KMS, Secrets Manager, Certificate Manager, and CloudFront. We also just released support for this in Elastic Load Balancer.

Let's take a trip down history lane for a second. Think back to the early 2000s. Some of you probably don't want to think about the year 2000 and some Y2K stuff there. Some of you may have no idea what I'm talking about, but you can Google it later. If you wanted to support a new encryption protocol in your application stack in the early 2000s, that was a ton of work. It was a whole refactor, a whole infrastructure upgrade, just a massive amount of work.

With AWS, if you want to support post-quantum cryptography with these services, it's a checkbox in your CloudFormation, Terraform, Pulumi, OpenTofu, or whatever else is out there these days. It's a line or two of code. That's all you have to do, and then your traffic is post-quantum encrypted as long as your client supports it. You can support multiple encryption protocols, so if your client doesn't support ML-KEM, they use RSA or elliptical curve. If your client supports ML-KEM, then they upgrade to ML-KEM and use that. As your clients become more modern, you can just enforce ML-KEM on these things with your TLS policies.

It's really cool to think about how hard it was 20 years ago and how easy it is today.  Quantum key distribution is really cool because it's a way to prove through physics that when we exchange a key over a quantum network and an entangled network, nobody saw that key exchange. We use the Schrödinger principle, which says that when we do this key exchange, if there's someone in the middle, that state is going to change and flatten out. On the other side, we can see that someone observed that key exchange, and we just won't use that key because it's compromised.

When you prove it, it's a law of physics that you cannot break. It's really cool emerging technology, and AWS has been studying quantum key distribution for years. You can see a link from several years ago where we created a quantum network over a couple of kilometers, and some other research is going on in that neighborhood. We're going to see this as an emerging technology in AWS. There's a really great session, INV-507, which I suggest you go to if you get a chance. It's a great topic to explore if you will, and it's a great thing to think about in terms of what's next in key exchange and how we make sure that nobody can observe that key.

What do you do? How do we get to encrypt everything? Take these steps to get to a more secure future. Inventory your environment.  Inventory it through AWS Config, through VPC encryption controls, through Security Hub, and all these tools that are available to you to inventory your environment and your on-premises environment. Understand what's being encrypted and what's not, and where it's being encrypted. What's being transmitted? Is it sensitive data

or is it something that honestly nobody cares if it's in plain text, right? Think about that. Inventory it, audit it. Go through that inventory and understand what is important and what's meeting your requirements. Think through that. Start enforcing encryption. How do you enforce it? You have to start having that conversation at the top. You have to start talking to your CISOs, to your CIO, to even your CEO, and start having a conversation about the need to take encryption seriously and enforce it.

AWS makes this breezy, right? We have all these things that are just super easy ways to onboard to encryption. On-premises, maybe not so easy and maybe requires a little more investment. But start enforcing it and remediate those things that are missing out in your audit. In your inventory and audit, identify what needs to be fixed, and then repeat because things change.

A developer went and built some new cool thing and said, "Oh yeah, I'm not going to use encryption because it's hard and it's just a dev environment." Of course, what happens to every dev environment in the world? It gets promoted to production. And oops, we forgot to encrypt it. So you have to continuously go through this cycle: continuously inventory, audit, enforce, remediate, and repeat.

With that, I would like to thank you for coming to our session. I know that it's during lunch hour and kind of the day before re:Invent starts, so we really appreciate your time. If you enjoyed our session, go into your app and give us five stars and some feedback. If you didn't enjoy our session, go into the app and give us some honest feedback. We love your feedback.

If you have any questions, Akshay and I will be right outside those doors across from the content hub right after this. We need to get out of here so we clear some space out, but we can meet you over there and answer any questions you have. Thank you.
