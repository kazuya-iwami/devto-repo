### The Multicloud Developer Challenge: Complexity in Modern Development Environments

 Yes, so hi, welcome everyone. My name's Chris. Quick question for the audience here. I know you're all very busy, but one of the things I wanted to understand is who loves installing SDKs and installing containers as a developer? This guy, okay, awesome. Well, you're at the right talk because we're going to be talking about how to simplify the developer experience today. I'm also joined by Brent Burgess, and I'll let Brent introduce himself shortly from Macquarie Group and how they've solved that challenge.

[![Thumbnail 30](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/30.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=30)

 So we're going to run through today what do we mean by multicloud. We talked about the multicloud developer experience, but what do we mean by multicloud? How do we make that experience a bit easier for our developers to build, and what are some of the challenges with building across multiple clouds and actually as a developer in general? We're going to hear how Macquarie Group has solved that problem, and then we're going to hear some of the learnings and some of the impact that's had on that organization. I'm also going to share some links where you'll be able to see more details about what I've touched on today, but also some other approaches that you can actually learn from.

[![Thumbnail 60](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/60.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=60)

 Great, so what do we mean by multicloud? It's pretty simple. It means using one or more clouds to achieve some sort of purpose and to deploy services. We're really going to be talking about the developer experience of that today. So what are some of the challenges with running a multicloud, right?

[![Thumbnail 80](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/80.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=80)

 You may have had to run in multicloud for a number of reasons. Maybe there's some functions or services that you want to use from different cloud providers. Maybe you've had acquisitions, and then also you could be looking at using tools from vendors that may be on different clouds as well. So how do we approach that from the AWS perspective? We've very much put it into a people, process, and technology perspective. I guess generally people mostly focus on technology, but there is the people and process component of it today. There's a number of frameworks out there that talk about how to operate in multicloud, so definitely check those out as you get into that process.

[![Thumbnail 120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=120)

 So let's talk about specifically challenges for the developer, right. When we look at IDEs, when a developer rocks up to their IDE and starts wanting to provide some business value, they have to install an IDE. All of our organizations have way more than one. We've got VS Code, we've got Cloud9, we've got Cloud Code, all those sorts of things. You have to configure that in your personal way. You may have to configure some things for your organization about how the code is formatted, camel case or whatnot. And then you've also got to do Windows versus Mac and all these sorts of things that we have to sort out. So there's one challenge right there, just getting the IDE right.

You start thinking about enterprises where they've got multiple identities across different clouds, technologies, all those sorts of things. They've got network access to understand, so they might need to connect to the development databases. Then they've got to manage their secrets, so SSH keys to access different environments. They've also got a bunch of tools on their desktop that they'll need to interact with, so Docker is obviously a very one front of mind. They'll have to interact with Artifactory or some sort of CI/CD, and these are all things that the developer will have to configure.

Now what we've added into the mix recently, and we've seen an explosion on, and we're all here at re:Invent, we've heard there's actually a talk one right next door talking about the AI augmentation of the developer experience. How do we set those tools up in a secure way that may need to meet guardrails and things that your organization has? So there's some of the challenges we've got here. I'm going to hand over now to Brent, who's going to talk about how Macquarie has dealt with some of these challenges and some of the innovation that they've done to help.

[![Thumbnail 220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=220)

### Macquarie Group's Multicloud Strategy: Empowering Engineers Across a Global Financial Services Organization

 Alrighty, thanks Chris. So yes, I'm Brent Burgess. I work for Macquarie Group. So today I'll just talk a little bit about Macquarie and who we are and what we do, and then I'll talk about what we've done to effectively accelerate the engineering experience at Macquarie.

[![Thumbnail 240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/240.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=240)

 So Macquarie Group, we're a global financial services organization. We operate in 31 different countries. We have roughly 20,000 employees globally, and we're a very diverse financial services organization. So we have an asset management group, we have a capital management group trading. We also have a retail bank, so we have a full end-to-end retail bank in Australia. It's a digital only bank, so no branches, no ATMs. That's a very diverse set of customers and clients that we need to service globally.

[![Thumbnail 270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=270)

 We've had a cloud first strategy for the best part of 11 years, and our cloud strategy is really about driving innovation and agility so we can deliver outcomes for our clients and customers at speed. And at this point in time we're about 70%, over 70% of all of our infrastructure and applications are hosted in public cloud.

[![Thumbnail 300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=300)

 And so more recently our multicloud strategy, again that multicloud strategy is about delivering innovation and agility to the business.

So we're in both AWS and GCP. We have well over 80 services enabled for our application engineers to leverage in order to deliver value and applications to our customers and clients. In the last year, we've had two out of three of every engineer either certified or trained in public cloud, and we have well over 1,000 applications hosted natively in public cloud.

[![Thumbnail 330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=330)

[![Thumbnail 350](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/350.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=350)

 So as I said, what does multi-cloud mean to Macquarie? It is about driving innovation and agility. It's about the best of breed services through the cloud services providers so our application engineers can deliver value and outcomes to our customers and clients.  But what does that bring? That brings multiple tool sets, different environments. You think about the different parts of our business, whether it's asset management, capital management, trading, a digital bank, core banking. They're all very diverse and different platforms that our application engineers are working on.

[![Thumbnail 370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=370)

[![Thumbnail 390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=390)

[![Thumbnail 410](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/410.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=410)

 With that brings a diverse set of frameworks and languages. So frameworks are always changing, they're always upgrading. The languages that we use predominantly are Python, Java, Go, Ruby, so we have to support all of those different languages and the associated frameworks across a global diverse business.  And of course that requires a broad skill set, so our engineers have to be multifaceted. They have to be capable of working on different tools and different platforms in order to service the demands of our business. And of course again, that's in the context of an organization that operates in  31 different countries, 20,000 employees, and multiple different markets.

[![Thumbnail 420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=420)

[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=430)

[![Thumbnail 440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=440)

So our vision at Macquarie  is to create a place where engineers thrive, and so what do we mean by that? We want to empower our developers. We want to give them the best tools, the sharpest tools, the best  laptops, the best frameworks, the latest languages in order for them to deliver outcomes for our customers and our clients. We want to accelerate delivery. We want to keep  our engineers focused on business problems as opposed to some of the challenges Chris spoke about at the start. So whether that's SSH keys, access to Artifactory, are you in the right AD group, do you have the right tools and frameworks installed on your laptop? We want to take the vast majority of that complexity away from our engineers so they can focus on accelerating delivery for our customers and clients.

[![Thumbnail 470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=470)

[![Thumbnail 480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=480)

### Dexd: A Developer Experience Platform for Rapid Onboarding and Multicloud Service Enablement

And again, that really just enables us to  deliver business outcomes at scale across a globally diverse business. And so how do we do that? We've built a platform that we call Dexd.  So that's our Developer Experience Daemon. It's based on Microsoft's dev containers, and I'll walk you through a few examples of how that works and then I'll give you a real world example of how we've enabled multi-cloud development using the Dexd platform.

[![Thumbnail 500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/500.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=500)

[![Thumbnail 520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=520)

And so what does Dexd do? It's about rapid  onboarding. It's taking away the complexity of whether you're in a particular AD group, have you authenticated with Artifactory, do you have Docker installed, is the sidecar running, all of the frameworks and tools that you need locally in order to be productive on day one. It's about providing that paved path,  so rather than having a multitude of different environment setups for each engineer within the same team, we have these consistent environments so we can manage and support them at a global scale.

[![Thumbnail 540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=540)

[![Thumbnail 560](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/560.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=560)

And then being a global financial services  company, we are regulated in multiple markets. We have our own internal control frameworks and security requirements, and so what we do is we try to shift left all of those compliance controls and frameworks into the engineering experience on the local laptop as opposed to dealing with them later in the development cycle as you approach production.  And again, all of this is about keeping our engineers and our developers in flow for longer, focused on business outcomes rather than wrestling with the setup of their development environment.

[![Thumbnail 580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=580)

[![Thumbnail 590](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/590.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=590)

So what does it look like? So every engineer has the Dexd  daemon installed automatically on their laptop, and when they go to localhost in their browser, you're presented with this really visually  appealing dashboard with all of the configuration. Traffic light.

If something is not right, you can actually click on the traffic light and Dexd will do one of two things. It'll either fix it automatically or it'll send you directly to the documentation so you can set up your configuration, authenticate without a factory, or make sure you're in the correct AD group or have access to our control plane. That's really reducing the setup of the engineering experience and environment on the local laptop.

[![Thumbnail 640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/640.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=640)

[![Thumbnail 660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/660.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=660)

Once you've got the green traffic light for all of the configuration that's required to start writing software, we then provide you with a default  set of dev containers or images that you can base your dev container on. As I said, we have a multitude of diverse tools and frameworks, and we deploy multiple operating systems into the cloud environment for the different types of applications that we build. Once you've selected the base image for your dev container,  we then present you with tens of different pre-baked templates for the types of applications, tools, and frameworks that you need to build the software or the applications that meet the business problem that you're working on. For those of you in the audience that have a keen eye, you'll notice that we have both the AWS and GCP frameworks as a template to accelerate that multi-cloud service enablement on day one.

[![Thumbnail 690](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/690.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=690)

[![Thumbnail 720](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=720)

 So let's see if I can bring it to life with an actual real world example of how we do multi-cloud enablement at Macquarie. The way we think about multi-cloud enablement at Macquarie is two aspects. We have our service builders, so those cloud engineers that are enabling multi-cloud services for the consumption by our application teams or our service consumers.  On the service builder side, we have a pre-baked template with Dexd that installs all of the framework components so that our engineers can start enabling services across multiple cloud providers. We install or provide a stripped down version of Kubernetes, Crossplane, Argo, LocalStack, and Moto.

We've shifted left the service enablement, the cloud engineering, so our engineers can use the power of their laptops rather than having to make changes locally and push them up into a shared development environment. When we first started on our multi-cloud journey, we were pretty fast, but it was only a handful of engineers and our changes rarely conflicted with one another. But as the team grew, we found that this shared development environment, where we were working on the same compositions to enable the same services, we would often conflict. What we've done now is by shifting that entire stack and providing that framework in the developer container, we can do most of the engineering effort before going anywhere near a shared environment. That's really accelerated the enablement of services on multiple cloud providers.

[![Thumbnail 800](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/800.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=800)

Then on the service consuming side,  and again, no presentation would be complete without mentioning AI, what we're doing is we're pre-training a model with all of the services that we've enabled on each of the clouds so that as a service consumer inside your IDE you can generate a Crossplane claim which is compliant based on the services that we've previously enabled. Again, that's really accelerated both the service enablement and the service consumption so that our engineers worry less about the controls and guard rails around each service that we've enabled, but leveraging those multi-cloud services so they can deliver value to our customers and our clients.

[![Thumbnail 850](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/850.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=850)

What's the impact, what's the business outcome of Dexd at Macquarie?  Rapid onboarding. I've spoken about this at length. It really does reduce the onboarding of engineers down from days and sometimes weeks. It's not until a week or two later that you find that you're missing an SSH key or you're not in the correct AD group to leverage a particular service that we have internally. It's not just about rapid onboarding of new developers or engineers. Often people will swap teams, and when you swap teams it's almost like starting in a whole new company. You have to learn how that team works and what tools and frameworks that they use. This accelerates the movement of engineers so they can work on different parts or different applications, even in different divisions, far more rapidly than what they have in the past.

[![Thumbnail 900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=900)

And again, shifted left, all of the configuration  leveraging the power of the laptop so that our engineers, particularly with multi-cloud, can focus on enabling services rapidly to meet the expectations of our business and spending more time in flow.

[![Thumbnail 920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=920)

And then finally it's about velocity. So enabling the best of breed multi-cloud services  so that our engineers can deliver value and outcomes to our business at scale. And then ultimately empowering our engineers to thrive.

### Platform Evolution and Impact: Scaling Developer Experience with Minimal Support Overhead

Thanks Brent. Chris, yeah, thank you, and look, thanks for running through that Brent, it is really interesting and just a couple of questions that came to mind for me. I mean, how long did it take to build an experience like that for your developers? Was it something that happened over years or is it something that's happened quite quickly?

Yeah, so it's taken us a few years just to build up the base capabilities, so we looked at the highest value, where was most of the toil in the engineering setup and then we've been progressively building out each of those base images to the point now we have tens of templates. And then we also have an inner sourcing model where engineers can contribute to the platform, so the actual multi-cloud service enablement or service builder template came from one of the cloud engineers.

Got you, so it's sort of grown out, scratching an itch and, you know, turned into the platform that exactly 1000 engineers are using now, great. And I mean on that, how many people support that platform now, given that you've got 1,000 plus engineers as you said?

Yeah, we have thousands of engineers dispersed globally and there's one person supporting the platform. Great, okay, so it kind of runs itself to some extent. Yep, probably that one person doesn't say that, but you know with AI tools coming in and I guess, you know, you talked about flow of the developer, how are you using Dexd to interact or how are you seeing developers interact with your internal tools? You know, we saw on the screenshot there a couple of internal Macquarie tools there, are you using Dexd with, you know, MCPs or something like that to augment the developer experience or make it easier for them to work?

Yeah, of course, so obviously we've enabled the AWS MCP servers, but we're also using it for our own platform, so our cloud control plane is quite, it's very mature, it's been running for the best part of 11 years. And some of the things that we're looking to do again it's about reducing cycle time and increasing velocity. So we're MCPs that have been looking at some of the build failures, and so as an engineer I can sit in my development environment, if I'm looking to consume a service, I can use the chat window and then the MCP will go and determine and often give us back the correction to the claim, because it knows, based on previous examples.

[![Thumbnail 1080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/1080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=1080)

Oh, very nice, oh that's great. Well thanks Brent for sharing all that with us, that's been super interesting,  and look, I just wanted to touch on a couple of other talks here along a similar track. So if you found this interesting, definitely check out the Adobe's session. It'll be available on YouTube within sort of 48 hours of the presentations there as well, so you can check it out when you get home.

[![Thumbnail 1100](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/0c0404bd69033f84/1100.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFxGuoZLj6E&t=1100)

Now I did promise to share some links with you, so here's the  QR codes for that. The top two are the AWS multi-cloud pages, but probably the most interesting one here in my view is the Macquarie Engineering blog. There will be a blog post coming around next, so looking forward to seeing that. But there's a bunch of other really great content on there about how they manage their control plane that Brent touched on and also their secrets management and a few things like that, so definitely check that out.

Brent also mentioned that they used development containers, and that's the link there to that as well, so that's a really interesting tool that we've seen many developers pick up. So with that, we'll wrap up there, we'll be over here, so if you've got any questions afterwards, please do get in, please feel free to come over and it'd be great if we could get some feedback in the survey that's part of the app as well, so with that, we'll wrap up there. Thanks very much for your time. Thank you.
