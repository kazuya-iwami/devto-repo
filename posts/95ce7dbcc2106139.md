# Overview


📖 **AWS re:Invent 2025 - Using AI to improve humanitarian workload resilience (AIM336)**

> In this video, Matt and Mike demonstrate building an AI-powered resilience advisor agent using Strands Agent and Amazon Bedrock to analyze AWS workloads for humanitarian applications. They explain AWS's three-pillar resiliency framework (high availability, disaster recovery, continuous improvement) and five failure categories (single points of failure, excessive load, excessive latency, misconfiguration/bugs, shared fate). The demo progressively builds an agent that uses Claude Sonnet 3.5, integrates the Cloud Control API and AWS documentation MCP server, implements session management with S3, and generates letter-graded resilience assessments based on RTO/RPO requirements. They emphasize the importance of detailed, specific prompting (145-line system prompt) to reduce ambiguity and improve consistency. The agent autonomously analyzes CloudFormation stacks, provides actionable recommendations with AWS documentation links, and can generate observability improvements and operational runbooks without explicit prompting for those tasks.

### Building for Failure: The Critical Importance of Resilience in Humanitarian Workloads

 Thank you all for being here. I know Werner is doing a keynote right now, and so I will channel him a little bit and talk about one of his famous quotes: everything fails all the time. I want to highlight the second part of that quote, that build for failure and nothing will fail. Having your applications not fail is pretty standard for all of us that we want to build, and it's really important in a lot of domains. But it's most important, I would say, when you're building humanitarian workloads, things that are meant to help people in need during a catastrophic event.

[![Thumbnail 40](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/40.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=40)

 In our world today, unfortunately, we live with constant humanitarian crises, and so we want to be able to build our applications to meet the needs of our users who are suffering in one of these events. It's not okay for a 404 or a timeout when someone is calling for help in an emergency like a flood. Having high reliability and resiliency is really crucial in these humanitarian workloads, and as builders and operators of these workloads, we need to prioritize building in resiliency when we go to develop our systems.

You don't need me to tell you that building resilient systems is hard. Things that are highly available, self-healing, maybe even multi-region, these are complex technical tasks that need attention and effort. So what we want to talk about today is how we can leverage tools like generative AI, and in particular agentic AI, to help make that easier for us. How can we take these new tools to help improve the resiliency of our workloads?

[![Thumbnail 130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/130.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=130)

### Understanding AWS Resiliency: High Availability, Disaster Recovery, and Continuous Improvement

Before we get into the actual building of this agent, let's first go over some basics of resiliency so that we have a common lexicon as we're going forward.  As we think of resiliency at AWS, we have this mental model broken into three different parts. The first is around high availability. This is the concept of how can our primary application, our active site of our application, withstand common failures that might impact the availability of our service. These are things like a server going down, a network interruption, things like that. If we want our applications to be highly available, we want them to be able to be resilient to these common failures that happen pretty much every day.

The second topic is around disaster recovery. This is when there is a major impact that is influencing our primary site and so we need to fail over to a secondary site. How do we do that? This would be when a disaster hits your primary site of your application where it is no longer able to serve traffic, and so you need to fail over to a secondary location. How quickly are you able to do that, and how are you able to then serve that traffic from your secondary site, and then also fail back over to your primary site once the event is over?

The third component is the continuous improvement of your applications over time. We all know this is true for new features and improving performance, but it is still as critical for resiliency as well. Once you launch an application, it's not done. It's not static. You need to be able to also improve resiliency over time based off of learnings of failures that will happen in your application. So taking the learnings and the hard lessons from failures that you withstand, putting it back into the application, and then just over time as you add new features, new problems can arise and just building over and over, iterating on that to improve it.

### Five Categories of Failures: From Single Points to Shared Fate

With that mental model in mind, we then have different categories of failures that we define. These five categories are those buckets where errors will occur, failures will happen, and so we bucket them into these five categories for ease of identification, but also for remediation. Starting with the first one, most people are familiar with this: single points of failure. So in your design of your application, if there's any component that is by itself or running on a single box, anything like that where if that component were to fail, it brings down your application and you have a bad day. When we're looking at this, we're looking at how do we expand that single point of failure to be not a single point, but have redundancy in it so that it can withstand any individual failure.

[![Thumbnail 300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=300)

 Next is excessive load, so looking at is our application able to withstand a sudden increase in load.

This could be anything from making sure you can scale elastically, either ahead of the load or in response to the load, and also making sure that you have the headroom, whether it be service limits within AWS or whatever capacity you might need to start to accept and handle that traffic.

[![Thumbnail 330](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/330.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=330)

 Next is around excessive latency. Is our application built to withstand any kind of network interruptions? Are the timeouts that we're building within our code able to accept variations where sometimes it's 5 milliseconds, sometimes it's 200 milliseconds? Will our application handle that increased latency of different calls between dependencies and be successful in handling that kind of unknown, or will it start to think that other parts of the application are down if you have an increased latency somewhere in your chain of dependencies?

[![Thumbnail 370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=370)

Next is around misconfiguration or bugs.  You know, pretty self-explanatory. Is there a bug in your code? Is there a misconfiguration in one of your dependencies? These things always happen, right? So are you able to either roll back a deployment, or are you able to put out a patch in time to prevent any kind of issues from cascading as you move along?

[![Thumbnail 400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=400)

And then the final one is shared fate. Do you have any  common dependencies across applications such that a failure of one of those common dependencies starts to impact outside of its fault isolation zone, where multiple applications will start to fail because of a single component having an issue? So with these categories in mind, if you took notes, great, they will show up later as we start to look at how we can identify areas of improvement in our applications. These five categories will be the framework for which we're looking for improvements and identifying remediations where there are problems.

[![Thumbnail 470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=470)

### Leveraging Agentic AI and Cloud Control API to Assess Workload Resilience

So as I said earlier, we are looking to build an agent for us to help identify these improvements. And so just, I know you've been beaten over the head with it all week, but just in summary of Agentic AI, you're building an agent to have agency. It will be able to take autonomous action on our behalf to investigate our workloads, using the foundation model for reasoning and then a list of tools that we're giving it so that it can take action within our account, look at  the applications that are running, take action to find the documentation that is necessary for it to provide recommendations, and then have an assessment of our workload overall.

[![Thumbnail 490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=490)

So a quick architecture diagram of what we're building. It's  fairly straightforward. We are building this agent, and Mike will go through how we're building it in our code, but as a quick summary of it, we are leveraging a foundation model from Amazon Bedrock. Our inference is coming from Bedrock, and then we are creating a couple of tools that Mike will go through, but we're also leveraging existing tools by AWS.

So the two that I want to call attention to are the Cloud Control API. If you're not familiar with this, this is an API that just exists for AWS where you're able to do CRUD operations against your account and against your environment for creating any resource, reading a resource, anything like that, and then the AWS documentation. So both of these are tools that we're leveraging existing MCP servers, or Model Context Protocol servers, that AWS runs to access these resources. And Mike will kind of walk through how that works within the code, but we are just reaching out with our agent to these existing tools so that we're able to look at an existing CloudFormation stack within our account and evaluate that stack and then use the AWS documentation to provide specific recommendations on how to improve. So being able to look at the current state of our account and our applications and then give us specific actionable things to do based off that feedback.

[![Thumbnail 580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=580)

 One last thing before we get into the code. We'll be looking at an application running in Mike's account. This particular application, not really important what it does, but as you start to see the recommendations that the agent is giving us, I just want to give you a little bit of context. This particular application is for an agent that is providing food assistance based off a blog post that Mike wrote a couple months ago.

This isn't super important for the talk, but just to give you context for what we're looking at as the agent goes through. And so with that, Mike, over to you.

### Building a Basic Strands Agent: First Steps and Initial Limitations

All right, so let's build something. I'm going to build this in Strands Agent. By show of hands, have any of you built anything in Strands Agent before? Nobody. Awesome, and you are in the right place. I'm going to step you through the build of all of this, and I'm going to explain what we're doing and how we actually built this out. I'm going to be creating two pieces. The first is the actual agent that goes and uses the Cloud Control API that uses an AWS documentation MCP server. It will go to my AWS account, pull back resources, and reason about what's in my account. We'll pull back relevant documentation around those five areas of resilience we talked about, and it will then generate a report for me, kind of like a report card where I can see what is the resilience of this workload. As I change my recovery time objective and recovery point objectives, I'll be able to get insight into whether the workload does or doesn't support some of those requirements that I have.

[![Thumbnail 690](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/690.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=690)

[![Thumbnail 700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=700)

All right, so the first thing I've done is I have created a really basic agent here. And if you look at the agent,  you can see that my prompt is, you are an AI-powered AWS resilience expert analyzing and enhancing fault tolerance and recoverability for mission  critical applications. Provide actionable, insightful guidance to identify vulnerabilities and implement robust solutions aligned with AWS best practices and specific business requirements. You generate all output in a GitHub markdown format. You know, you can have your output in lots and lots of different ways. I arbitrarily decided that for this solution I wanted it to output in a GitHub markdown format.

[![Thumbnail 730](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/730.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=730)

[![Thumbnail 740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/740.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=740)

Great. Now when you create an agent with Strands Agent,  there are really two methods that you have to have. And let me show you the easiest one first, really the smallest one. You need to have a method that returns the status.  And in this case, I'm calling this my ping method, and what this does is it just returns healthy, and I decorate that with this decorator app.get ping. And so that tells Strands Agent whenever a request comes into the slash ping URL it will return status healthy. That's the first method I need.

[![Thumbnail 760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=760)

[![Thumbnail 770](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/770.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=770)

[![Thumbnail 780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=780)

[![Thumbnail 830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=830)

 The second method I need is an invocations method, and this method is a post, and it returns on slash invocations.  And this method is really the heart of my agent. So anytime a request comes in, I look at any JSON that's being  passed in. I'm expecting a JSON element called message. That's my prompt that I'm passing in. I'm going to take that, and that's my prompt. And I'm creating an instance of an agent. An agent is a built-in class in Strands Agent. It allows me to create an agent like we've talked about. And my system prompt here is just the system prompt that I showed you up here earlier, you are an AWS resilience expert. And all I'm doing is I am creating, I'm passing that agent my prompt, whatever prompt is that I'm receiving here in that JSON messages object. It's generating the result, and I display the result  in a JSON format. So right now, this doesn't do anything particularly useful, but this is really the building blocks of a much more complex agent that we're going to be building through this.

[![Thumbnail 850](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/850.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=850)

[![Thumbnail 880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=880)

All right, now when I invoke or when I run this agent, this will be running, you know, if I run this locally,  this will be running on port 8080. And if I want to invoke anything like if I want to call that ping method, I've got to call, I have to curl to get slash ping. If I want to actually invoke this, I have to perform a post to that slash invocations. And so just to make this easier, I am going to create a Python script that allows me to easily interact with my agent.  And let me show you, actually let me just save that file there. Let me show you what this file looks like.

[![Thumbnail 890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=890)

[![Thumbnail 900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=900)

Pretty straightforward. I've got one  method to clear the screen. My main method here, when I start it up, it's going to say resilience advisor, it's going to have a bunch of equal signs.  It's going to give me some instructions around how to quit.

[![Thumbnail 910](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/910.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=910)

[![Thumbnail 920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=920)

[![Thumbnail 940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=940)

I'm creating a continuous loop that runs while  true. It's going to ask for some user input. Whatever input I give it, it's going to  create that JSON object with that message. So really what this user input is, is the prompt that I want to send to my agent. It's going to send that in or create a JSON object with that. I've got some administrative things here, and then it's going to perform a POST to my agent that  is running at /invocations. Then if I get a 200 back, I'm going to clear the screen and print out the results. Remember that I set up my agent so that it's printing the results or generating the results in a GitHub markdown format, and so I'm using some libraries here to nicely print out that markdown format.

[![Thumbnail 990](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/990.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=990)

So let's just run this and see what this looks like. I've got two consoles here now. In the real world, if I was running this in production, of course I'm not going to run this in a console. We'll talk more about how to actually operationalize this in a bit, but just so that you understand how this is all working, you can see how all the pieces work together. On the right-hand side, this is my agent. So I'm going to run my agent, and you're going to see it is running on  port 8080. On the left-hand side, this is my client that I'm using to interact with my agent.

Because I've got both of these side by side, you're going to be able to see me issue commands through my client. You're going to see those go to the agent, you're going to see the agent process, do some stuff, and return the results back to the client, and then the client will display the results. So I've got a prompt. Well, you know what, this is a resilience talk. I want to improve the resilience of my workload.

[![Thumbnail 1040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1040)

[![Thumbnail 1050](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1050.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1050)

[![Thumbnail 1060](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1060.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1060)

So let's ask it something. I have a  workload with the tag of AWS CloudFormation stack name and value of food-agent. Help me understand  the resilience of my workload. So that request is going off to my resilience agent, and you can see here how it's processing. It's going to be doing some stuff, it's reasoning about my request, and in just a moment, we'll get some results  back.

[![Thumbnail 1070](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1070.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1070)

[![Thumbnail 1080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1080)

[![Thumbnail 1090](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1090.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1090)

All right, so here's my results, so let's look at this really quickly.  So it says I'll help you analyze the resilience of your food-agent, and if we look through this, it tells me what to do here. You can look at CloudFormation. Here are some things  to look at here. Think about a multi-AZ deployment. This is not useful, right? This is not looking at my workload.  So I built a really simple agent, but it doesn't actually do anything super useful right now. So let's take this to a next step and actually build something that's kind of useful.

[![Thumbnail 1110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1110)

### Enhancing the Agent with Structured Prompts and Custom Tools

So let's clear this out. Let's go back  and see if we can improve our agent a little bit.  I've made some updates to my agent here. Let's look through and let me show you what I've changed. Notice my system prompt is a lot bigger than it  was before. So I've got the same basic system prompt as you originally saw, but now I've got a few other things.  Perform only non-mutative actions when using the use_aws tool. We'll talk more about what that means in just a moment.

[![Thumbnail 1170](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1170.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1170)

[![Thumbnail 1180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1180)

Critical: when analyzing a workload, provide your response in exactly this format.  I want it to look like this: RTO/RPO Analysis, classify as high, medium, low, and brief justification. You remember those five areas that Matt talked about for resilience?  You remember it was the acronym SEEMS. S stands for, anyone remember? Single points of failure. My first E was for excessive load, next E was excessive latency, the M was misconfiguration and bugs, and the S was shared fate. I'm calling them slightly different things here, but

[![Thumbnail 1220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1220)

I'm asking this resilient agent to generate my results according to those five categories that are really the properties I need to have a resilient application, and I'm asking it to create a letter grade. What I want to be able to do is look and see, for redundancy,  is it an A, B, C, D, or F? That helps me really quickly express to my leadership whether we need to invest in engineering work or not.

Now, you may remember from the previous example, I hadn't actually specified the large language model that  I'm using. I don't know if you noticed that. Here, I'm actually telling it what LLM I want to use. In this case, I'm using Claude Sonnet 4.5, and I'm setting this up as a Bedrock model. So I'm using Bedrock, I'm using the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model through Bedrock, and I'm setting my temperature.  There are lots of other parameters that I can set through this as well. I'm going to skip this letter grade for just a moment, and we'll talk about this more in just a moment.

[![Thumbnail 1280](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1280.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1280)

Let's get down to my invocations method, where I actually invoke my agent.  Same kind of thing as before. I'm getting some input from the user, I'm creating an agent here, and this part right here is a little bit different than what you saw before. When I create my instance of an agent, I'm telling it to use my Bedrock model that I set up earlier. That's how it knows to use Claude Sonnet 4.5, that's how it knows my temperature and all those other configurations. It's using the same system prompt, but now I'm giving it access to a set of tools, and I'm telling it the tools I want you to use are the use_aws tool and the calculate_letter_grade tool.

This is the fundamental part of how agents work. I give it access to an LLM and I give it access to a set of tools. In those tools, if the agent understands what the tools are, it can reason about what it needs to do to solve the problem that's in the prompt. So let's now talk a little bit about these tools.

[![Thumbnail 1350](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1350.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1350)

The first tool is the calculate_letter_grade tool. That's this guy right here. I created a method called calculate_letter_grade, and my idea  behind this calculate letter grade is I wanted to be able to really quickly see for shared fate, is my letter grade A, B, C, D, or F, so then I have a quick sense for whether I need to invest some time and effort to improve that. Honestly, this is probably kind of a naive method, but it works well enough. You can see that I am asking for a number of critical vulnerabilities, and these are critical resilience vulnerabilities, the number of high resilience vulnerabilities, the number of medium resilience vulnerabilities, and the number of low resilience vulnerabilities.

I'm giving some definitions here, and I'm doing these definitions so that the agent can reason about what this method is and how to actually use it. You can see I'm saying this calculates a letter grade based on the number of resilience issues in the workload. A workload with a low RTO RPO will have more resilience issues than that same workload with a high RTO RPO. In other words, if I have a recovery time objective, a recovery point objective of four days for each of those, I can have a lot more resilience problems there than if I have a workload with a two-minute recovery time objective and a two-minute recovery point objective.

[![Thumbnail 1430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1430)

[![Thumbnail 1460](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1460.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1460)

I'm defining what each of those inputs are for the critical, high, medium, and low resilience vulnerabilities, and  then my method is really, again, pretty naive. If I have any critical resilience problems, I'm saying the workload has a D. If I have any high resilience vulnerabilities, it's a C. Any medium resilience vulnerabilities, it's a B, otherwise it returns an A. Now the only thing I need to do to mark this as a tool for my agent to start using it is I simply put @tool.  That's using the Strands SDK, so it makes it super easy to write tool definitions and get those to work with your LLM.

[![Thumbnail 1470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1470)

### Integrating the use_aws Tool and Analyzing Real Workloads

So remember,  when I look at my agent and the tools I'm using, I mark that method with @tool, and then I give it the name of the method here. Now this next tool, the use_aws tool, this one is kind of interesting. If I look at where this is defined, if I look at the libraries  in my imports here, this is built in to the Strands SDK. There is a use_aws tool as part of Strands tools.

When you think about all the infrastructure you'd need to connect to your AWS account, there's a lot of complexity you'd have to build. You'd have to pull out your credentials, connect to the Cloud Control API, and then determine which method to call to find each of the resources in your account. Well, I don't have to worry about that because the use_aws tool does all that for me. All right, should we run this and see how this actually operates?

[![Thumbnail 1540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1540)

[![Thumbnail 1550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1550)

 Okay, so I'm going to run my agent here. Should look the same as before.  And I'm going to run my client, and let me ask the same question as before. I have a workload with the tag of AWS CloudFormation stack name and value of food-agent. The RTO is 24 hours and the RPO is 12 hours. Help me understand the resilience of this workload.

[![Thumbnail 1610](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1610.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1610)

[![Thumbnail 1620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1620)

All right, and what we're going to see now, you can see that the agent now says, all right, I'm going to help you analyze the resilience of your workload with this tag. Let me start by discovering the resources in this workload and assess them. And now you can see tool number one, use_aws, tool number two, use_aws. It is actually going out to my account and retrieving results based on that tag. And it's smart enough to realize that, hey,  I used a tag that's used in CloudFormation, so it's intelligent enough to realize it needs to go to CloudFormation to figure out that workload  and inspect the stack.

[![Thumbnail 1630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1630)

[![Thumbnail 1640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1640.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1640)

And then once it's retrieved those results, then it's going to start reasoning about that workload and,  you know, calculating the letter grade. And you can see through the output here that it has called the calculate_letter_grade tool a couple of times, and again, it's continuing to reason about that.  And we're going to, should hopefully get results here in just a second.

[![Thumbnail 1650](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1650.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1650)

And so Mike, as we're going through this and we're looking at that use of use_aws like you were saying,  because it's built into the Strands Agent, you don't actually need to say use the Cloud Control API. It knows if I'm looking at a CloudFormation stack, I need to use the Cloud Control API to be able to list resources, understand the stack itself. And in your prompt you'd mentioned that you put in only use non-mutative calls to the Cloud Control API. So as we said earlier, the API itself is full CRUD operations, so you could create a resource, you could update a resource, but you're specifying, hey, only do read-only so that we're just reviewing our application and we're not actually making changes in this exact agent.

Exactly, exactly. Now, and one of the reasons I, and I think that's a great point that you bring that up, one of the things that, you know, one of the reasons that I said use non-mutative API actions is, well, I'm running this locally and I'm using a profile that has administrative access, right? I'm sure many of us are a little bit sloppy in our engineering and we're full admins when we're running locally, right? But when I actually run this, if I were to actually deploy this in my account and have it be an agent that I'd want to interact with over time, I definitely don't want to give it admin access, right? So I could make sure that over time when it's running in my account, I assign a role that only has read-only permission. So I think that's a great point that you bring up there.

[![Thumbnail 1740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1740.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1740)

[![Thumbnail 1760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1760)

All right, so you can see that we've got some output here. Let's look at the output. Let me scroll to the top here.  And you can see it's done some analysis here. It gave redundancy a D, sufficient capacity a D, timely output a D, correct output a C, fault isolation a D. And it gave me some problems that I might need to look at here. But you know what? This workload has  a recovery time objective of 24 hours. Now if you don't remember what RTO or Recovery Time Objective means, that really means how much downtime is acceptable for this workload. And when I talk about my Recovery Point Objective or RPO, that's how much data loss is acceptable to me.

So you know, I'm saying that I'm essentially willing to have up to 24 hours of downtime and up to 12 hours of data loss. So this feels like a pretty low-risk application, right? These grades don't feel quite aligned with what I've got here, so let me just ask it, you know.

[![Thumbnail 1820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1820)

Do the grades accurately reflect the RTO and RPO that I provided? Okay, and this is my result here.  I don't have any context about previous grades or RTO RPO values that you provided. What? Oh, what's going on here? Anyone, anyone have any ideas? Is there a session state in our agent?

### Adding Session State with S3SessionManager for Contextual Conversations

Oh, we don't have any session state, so that's probably the issue, right? Okay, so what that essentially means is that every request I'm making to this agent endpoint is independent of any other request. So I asked it to look at my workload, it gave me a lot of results, but if I want to ask any follow-up questions, I can't do that because it doesn't remember the previous interaction. Okay, so we obviously need to add some session state here. So let's add that as the next step.

[![Thumbnail 1880](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1880.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1880)

[![Thumbnail 1900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1900.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1900)

[![Thumbnail 1920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1920)

All right.  Okay, so let's look at this and I'll show you what we ended up changing. So we have the same system prompt as before.  We didn't make any changes to the system prompt. We've got the same LLM, the same Bedrock model thing we've done before. The calculate letter grade is the same.  Let's see. But there is something different here, and I'm trying to remember, I'm trying to find it in the code  here.

[![Thumbnail 1940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1940)

Okay, there is one thing that we added here. I added a bucket name. Okay. The bucket is where I want to store my session data. Okay, so in this case, I have a bucket in my account called reinvent session data. That's where I'm going to be storing my session state. Now, if I go into the actual agent invocation here,  you're going to see now I'm going to try and get the prompt from the user. And then I'm going to try and get the session ID from the user. I'm expecting that that client to pass in a session ID. I'm going to get their session ID. If they don't give me a session ID, I'm going to raise an exception and return a 400 HTTP code.

[![Thumbnail 1970](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/1970.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=1970)

[![Thumbnail 2000](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2000.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2000)

I want to write out the session ID  and then I'm creating an instance of an S3SessionManager. So this is a built-in object to Strands Agent. And you can see here that I'm passing in the session ID, that ID that's coming through from the client. I'm telling it the bucket name, and there's a prefix in that bucket where I'm going to be writing my session data. I've created a prefix there that I'm just calling prod. That's where all my session data is going to be going. And if you look at my agent, all I'm doing is I'm adding  a session manager. And that's it, and I should hopefully have session data by doing that.

[![Thumbnail 2030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2030)

Now the last thing I really need to do is I need to go to my interactive file here, and I need to update this to provide a session ID. So all I've done here is I've created a session ID which in this case, I'm just using a UUID. And then I'm just adding that to  the payload that gets passed in to my agent. All right, so let's try this again and see how this works.

[![Thumbnail 2040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2040)

 All right, so let's clear this out.  All right, so let's try this again. I have a workload with the tag of AWS CloudFormation stack name and value of food-agent. The RTO is 24 hours and the RPO is 12  hours. Help me understand the resilience of this workload.

[![Thumbnail 2080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2080.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2080)

 Okay, so we're going to see the same thing kind of happening, but one thing you will see here though, is now I've got a session ID that's being emitted. You know, emitted from my  agent, so I can see that I'm getting in a session ID. We're going to see the same thing where it's going to pull resources from my account. It's going to reason about my workload,  yeah.

[![Thumbnail 2110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2110.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2110)

We're going to get hopefully the same result as before, and then now I should be able to ask it follow-up questions to validate what it's actually producing.   Okay, so you can see here now it's, you can hopefully see some  calls to, it's moving too fast, calculate letter grade. You can see now it's reasoning about that workload. It's already pulled everything back about it from my account. It's reasoning about it. It  is providing some recommendations. It's now creating the output and I should see that output in just a second here.  And do you all remember what my grades were before? Seems like it was mostly like C's and D's, right? They  weren't great. Yeah, it was not great. And if I look through this,  okay, looks like C's and D's, redundancy D. Okay, well, let's ask it a follow-up question. Given my RTO and RPO, are these grades accurate? You can see that it is printing out my session ID, so it's using the same session ID so I've got that context now. And I don't know if you, the  agent's moving pretty quickly, but if you're able to see that, it made a comment, hey, you're absolutely right, those grades don't make sense. Let me recalculate for   you.

And something we don't do here, but you can totally do depending on how you want your client, how your user to interact with the agent, would be to change how you stream back responses to your client, right? I think that's a great point. I am waiting for the complete result to be done before it comes back to the client. Yeah, but you're suggesting probably streaming would provide a much better user experience. Exactly. If we wanted to have that more interactive feel, like in a more chatbox way, being able to stream tokens back as soon as they're being generated would help to kind of improve that user experience over time, but for our purposes here, not super necessary. Yeah, no, but I think that's an excellent point. Definitely streaming that would provide a much better experience here.

[![Thumbnail 2290](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2290.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2290)

All right, so let's look at what this, what it returned to me. Gave me a lot of results. Let me just go to the top here.  Okay, you're absolutely right to question these grades with a 24 hour RTO and 12 hour RPO. Many of these issues I flagged as critical are actually nice to have or optimizations. All right, so then it said, now my redundancy grade is a B. My sufficient capacity grade is a B,  my timely output is a C, my correct output is a B. Okay, so it looks like most of my grades are now B's and C's, which I think seems more aligned with reality.

### Incorporating MCP Servers and Crafting a Comprehensive 145-Line System Prompt

Okay, so now let's take this a step further. So you think about, there's a couple of things going on that we've talked about here. So first of all, in terms of tool use, I've shown you how to use a tool that's built into Strands Agent, the use AWS tool. I showed you how to use a tool that I created myself, that calculate letter grade tool. The next thing I think is valuable to use is there are a lot of tools out there that are MCP servers. How do I actually integrate an MCP set of tools into my workload? So let's look at doing that. We also showed you how you can have more interactive conversations through things like session ID. But I feel like there's still some problems with my prompting here because I don't want to have to ask it, hey, are you sure that these grades are right? Are you sure that the way you analyze this is correct? That's not a great experience, right? I really want it to give me the correct results the first time without me having to really quiz it and challenge it on every single thing it brings up.

So in terms of next steps, I definitely want to add an MCP server. And I definitely want to improve my prompting so that I don't have to challenge it on everything. So let's go ahead and try to fix those kinds of things.

All right, so let's stop these and clear these out.  So let's go to my agent. I made a couple of changes here. Let's look at the changes that I've made.  The first change I made, remember before I had my prompt embedded in this file  here. I've now taken it out and put it in a separate file. I'll show you this prompt in just a moment. Can you think of any reasons why I might have done that? It's easier to maintain. There could be a lot of reasons. For me it's easier to maintain. You'll also see that as your prompt gets bigger and bigger, one thing that I see a lot of organizations deal with is they'll complain about how their agent does okay most of the time, but then it'll sometimes do things they don't really want it to do, or they don't see maybe some of the consistency they want.

Oftentimes when I see that, if they're using a model that has good direction following ability, usually it means that maybe you've got things in your prompt that are vague enough that the model needs to fill in the gaps. If it needs to fill in the gaps, then it's going to do things you may not expect or may not anticipate. That usually requires that you add more specificity to your prompt, which means that your prompt itself is going to get larger. As your prompt gets larger, if it's embedded in your code, then after a little while, most of your agent file here is going to be prompt. So that's why I broke that out. We'll see that more in just a moment.

Okay, so then the next thing I did is I wanted to use the AWS documentation MCP  server. Are any of you familiar with this MCP server? It is like my number one favorite MCP server. The reason it's my favorite is because all it does is it returns documentation and blog posts on AWS content. It's curated, managed by AWS. This went generally available about a month or two ago. It's awesome to use. If you want deep curated documentation, this is a great way to go.

[![Thumbnail 2580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2580)

[![Thumbnail 2590](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2590.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2590)

So this is my code to use that MCP server. I create a variable called aws_doc_mcp_client. I create an MCP, well, I use an MCPClient object, and I give it the URL of that MCP server, which is knowledge-MCP. So you can see it right there. And this MCPClient object  is really defined right here, so it's built into the Strands tools.  All right, so that's how I get my MCP client for that documentation server.

[![Thumbnail 2640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2640.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2640)

[![Thumbnail 2650](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2650.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2650)

Then to actually use it, I've made a few other changes here. The first time somebody runs this code, I really want to be able to ask, okay, what's the tag of the workload that you're interested in? What's the value of that tag? What's your RTO and RPO? Because those seem like the natural first questions this agent's going to want to know. Once I understand that, then I can actually process and do some other interesting things. So I've updated this code to retrieve a tag name and tag value if they're there, to retrieve an RTO and RPO if they're there, and then create a prompt something like, hey, this user workload is running in AWS, it's  defined by the tag, defined by tag name, the value is tag value, the RTO and RPO are this and that. 

[![Thumbnail 2660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2660.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2660)

The only other thing I've done here is, if you look at my agent, well, before my agent, I have this aws_doc_tools  variable that I've created. Remember that variable before, the aws_doc_mcp_client, that's my MCP client. All I do on that is I call list_tools_sync. What that command does is it goes out to the MCP server, it pulls back the tools that that server supports, and puts them in this aws_doc_tools variable. Then I just add that aws_doc_tools variable to my list of tools. That's literally all I have to do. It's so stupid simple, okay? And I love stupid simple. All right, now, the next thing I want to show you,

Let me show you my system prompt. This prompt is now 145 lines of code,  or 145 lines of text. Let's read through not everything here, but just give you a sense of what I'm doing. First thing I give it is a purpose. You are an AI-powered resilience expert. We've kind of seen that before. I give it a persona. You should embody a seasoned cloud architect with  10 years' experience designing and optimizing distributed systems, communicate with authority, precision, and approachability, ask probing questions, and offer tailored recommendations that inspire confidence. 

[![Thumbnail 2780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2780)

[![Thumbnail 2790](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2790.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2790)

I'm giving it a grading philosophy. You saw some of the problems I had with my grades, right, where it generated grades for me that didn't seem consistent. I asked it, are you sure, and it said, you're right, I'm not sure, let me try that again. So I'm giving it some directions on how to actually grade, because if you think about it, I say give it a letter grade A, B, C, or D, but there's a lot of things that the model has to assume in all of that. I'm providing it that specificity of what I want. So I'm giving it this grading philosophy. Grades reflect how well the current architecture meets the stated RTO and  RPO, not absolute architectural quality. I give it some core principles. The same architecture receives different grades based on RTO and RPO, and I give it some examples. 

[![Thumbnail 2830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2830.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2830)

[![Thumbnail 2840](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2840.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2840)

I give it a grading scale. What does an A mean versus a B versus a C versus a D versus an F? Again, you can see how, as a human, when I wrote that first set of prompts, there are a lot of things that I'm taking for granted where this model is having to make some decisions on its own about what does Mike actually mean when he says an A. Well, what I mean now is A means significantly exceeds requirements, it may be overengineered. That's much more specific and actionable by an LLM versus give me a letter grade. I'm giving it some requirements for my  RTO and RPO. High RTO and RPO means I have hours to days of tolerance. I give it some examples. A medium means I've got minutes to hours of tolerance, a low means  I've got seconds to minutes of tolerance.

[![Thumbnail 2850](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2850.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2850)

[![Thumbnail 2860](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2860.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2860)

[![Thumbnail 2870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2870)

I give it a grading matrix. For high RTO and RPO,  these are things I would expect to see. For a medium RTO and RPO, these are things I would expect to see. And for a low RTO and RPO,  these are things I would expect to see. I give it some directions for tool usage. When calculating letter grade, you must  always include the RTO and RPO in the context of the assessment. Frame the evaluation as for X hours or minutes of the RTO and RPO requirement, this setup meets, exceeds, or falls short. I give it an example here, and I say never call the tool without explicit RTO and RPO context.

[![Thumbnail 2890](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2890.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2890)

[![Thumbnail 2920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2920)

Then I have a grade verification section.  After calculating each letter grade, internally verify is grade X appropriate for the current architecture for the given RTO and RPO, and if it's inconsistent, recalculate. Now again, I'm hoping you see all of the areas that the LLM was having to essentially guess what I meant. Resilience definitions. I asked it before to categorize my resilience  posture in those five areas, but you'll also remember that I never bothered to explain what those five areas actually meant. So here that's what I'm doing. Redundancy means I'm eliminating single points of failure through component or system redundancy. You can read through all of those.

[![Thumbnail 2940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2940)

[![Thumbnail 2950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2950.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2950)

Now that I'm using that AWS documentation MCP server, I have  specific directions around how I want it to generate documentation for me. What I'm trying to achieve here is I want to have good recommendations, and if it's telling me that I need to maybe set up Lambda reserved concurrency,  I don't want it to give me a link to the Lambda landing page. That's not useful, right? But a link to the documentation on how to set up Lambda reserved concurrency, that's actually useful. That's what I'm trying to get at here. So that's what I'm saying here. Provide specific AWS documentation links to support all recommendations. Links must provide deep insight into the topic, not generic product pages.

[![Thumbnail 2990](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/2990.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=2990)

I give it an analysis process. Do this: accept the AWS workload tag value,  classify the RTO and RPO as medium, high, or low, execute only non-mutating API requests for each resilience area, state these things, calibrate all recommendations, and format output according to the response format section.

[![Thumbnail 3010](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3010.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3010)

[![Thumbnail 3020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3020.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3020)

[![Thumbnail 3030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3030)

[![Thumbnail 3040](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3040.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3040)

Now this response format section, this is probably what you remember. This is what we've  been looking at. This is the same as before, except I've now added a section here around where I want my AWS documentation links to be part of this output here.  And then I'm giving it some output rules. Be concise. Start immediately with formatted analysis. Don't include thinking tags.  Present only the structured response without preamble or conclusion. Every grade and recommendation must align with the stated RTO and RPO. If the architecture exceeds the requirements,  note potential cost optimization opportunities. And then I've got some final critical reminders here. Before finalizing any grade, ask yourself, did I classify the RTO RPO correctly? Does this grade make sense? Would the same architecture get a different grade with a different RTO RPO? Am I grading based on requirements fit, not architectural sophistication?

All right, so really the thing I want you to take away from this is, well, by raise of hands, are any of you surprised by the complexity of this prompt? Few people, yeah. And I hope you see that as you look through this, this is designed to take away the ambiguity that we originally had, and that's one of the key takeaways I want you to think of when you see your agent not operating the way it should. Ask yourself how much is the agent having to come up with?

### Testing Advanced Capabilities: Dynamic RTO/RPO Analysis, Observability Recommendations, and Runbook Generation

All right, so let's actually run this. But before I do that, I need to update, excuse me. I've just updated my interactive page just so that it includes a few  more things here. Let's actually just run this. And Mike, as you're on that, I want to highlight as well that the complexity of the prompt  and talking about breaking out into its own file, all of that gives you the ability to really iterate on that prompt. We're showing you the finished product here, but that took a lot of time and  execution and work to get it to that point. And as we're talking about the iterative process, it's not going to be a one and done with your  prompt. But also keeping it out there as you try different models, for example, we're using Claude Sonnet 3.5, but if you use a different family of models, how you structure your prompt will be different. The kinds  of tags that you give it will be different. And by treating it as just another asset within your code and within your development pipeline, you're able to more easily test  things out and iterate as you move along to build out your agents.

I think that's a great point, and when you're building a prompt like this that can be a little more complex,  a good approach is, say you know what you want it to look like. You can go into  an LLM. You can even go into the Bedrock console to the text playground we have there and say, hey, I'm trying to write this prompt.  I'm doing this in Claude Sonnet 3.5. This is my prompt, this is my output, and this is the output I want to get. Help me get there. What I'd recommend if you do something like that, don't  pick a Claude model. Pick a different model, a model from a different model family. You do that and it can give you really good direction on how to do this.  You know, hey, maybe you need to change your prompt to look like this or that.

Okay, so now I've got my results here. These are now aligned with what I want it to look like. Hey,  I've got my redundancy, my sufficient capacity, my letter grades here. This looks just like I want. Now let's see if we can do something a little more interesting. Let me ask you, how do these grades change if I change my RTO  to two hours and my RPO to thirty minutes? We're going to see here is if you look at the agent processing, it  already understands my workload, so it doesn't need to go back into my account. It's going to be recalculating those letter grades based on how it's reasoned about my workload. It's going to now go to the documentation.  It's going to search and retrieve documentation, and in just a moment we should see some results here. 

[![Thumbnail 3280](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3280.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3280)

Now one thing that's important to note is now you've all seen my prompt. I never gave it anything specifically to  reevaluate grades based on a different RTO RPO, but it's able to do that because it can reason about what's already there. And you're going to see in just a moment how I'm going to ask it  some things that truly aren't in my prompt. Okay, and you can see through here that most of my grades now are C's and D's for a lower RTO and RPO.

[![Thumbnail 3340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3340)

Let's try something even crazier. I know that I have observability problems with this workload. I would like to know what are maybe the top three things from an observability perspective that I should work on fixing to improve this workload. So let me ask you, what are the top three things I should focus on to improve the observability of my workload. 

[![Thumbnail 3360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3360.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3360)

Now you've seen my prompt. I've never mentioned anything about observability in the prompt, but it's able to again reason about my workload. You can see that it's searching the AWS documentation. It's going to reason about what it's searched in that documentation. It's going to pull back results, and hopefully soon I should have something that I can actually  action on. 

[![Thumbnail 3390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3390)

[![Thumbnail 3400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3400.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3400)

[![Thumbnail 3410](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3410.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3410)

It's giving me some good information here. So if I scroll to the top,  it tells me number one, I should implement CloudWatch alarms with automated alerting. Great tip, I don't have any alarms here. It tells me some ways I can do that. Enable X-Ray with distributed tracing.  Great idea, I don't have any tracing. It even gives me some code I could add. That's pretty cool. Number three, implement structured JSON logging with CloudWatch Logs Insights queries. 

[![Thumbnail 3420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/95ce7dbcc2106139/3420.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0m5d5DF6zk&t=3420)

I do have a log file, but I'm not really doing much with it. These are all great tips, and it gives me some quick wins, some quick implementation steps, a lot of really interesting things.  Let me just do one last thing here. I'm going to ask it to build me a runbook that I can use to recover from an operational event. Now, again, remember there's nothing in my prompt about building runbooks, but because it has access to these tools, it already understands my workload, it's able to search the AWS documentation, it's able to reason about that, it's able to reason about my workload and generate something that I can use that's actually pretty useful.

As it goes through here, very much like we're talking about getting more specific with the core part of our agent looking at doing that evaluation and recommendations, this runbook, if we're not happy with how it's displaying or the recommendations it gives, like Mike was saying we can be more specific within our prompt, give it that option of hey if someone asks for a runbook, format it in this form in this way or provide these specific components of that runbook. But we'll see here like it does a really good  job without that, but if we want to get better, more specific, we're able to provide that within that prompt to help refine those outputs. If you're following along with  what the agent is processing through, it's going pretty quickly, but if you're able to quickly read what it's doing, I mean it's looking for okay, maybe there is downtime, maybe  somebody accidentally deleted something. I mean there's a lot of different scenarios that it's thinking through how to recover. You can see like what if somebody  accidentally deleted my stack, how do you recover from that.

It's pretty interesting. So I could take this runbook that's generated,  I could then add that to my recovery actions, add that to my documentation. And  that gives me a good first step on how to have better resilience here. Let me just scroll to the top here and we'll just scan through this quickly so we can wrap up.  It gives me a lot of scenarios. What if you have S3 data loss or corruption, here's some things to do. Let's scan through. What if you have issues  with your Lambda function, how do you validate that your Lambda function's running. It tells me when should I escalate to AWS Support, again really good information here. We've got just a couple of seconds left. So Matt, let's wrap things up.

### Deploying to Production with Bedrock AgentCore and Additional Resources

Yeah, so we talked a lot about all those  different steps in building the agent itself and we also alluded to we're running all of this locally on Mike's machine, great for him, not great for everyone else in our organization. So how do we make that more usable by everybody? One really good way to do that would be to deploy this agent to Bedrock AgentCore to use that runtime as a hosting platform for having this agent be applicable or be usable by everyone in our organization.

The Strands Agent that we've built can be bundled up and sent to Bedrock AgentCore to host the agent itself, making it usable by everyone in our organization. Everything that we've written can still reach out to those tools that were defined, including the MCP Servers, and then things like sessions can be handled by Bedrock AgentCore. Things like observability and tracing of the agent itself are also handled by Bedrock AgentCore, so it really helps us to host this and make it more applicable for everyone else.

From here, if you want to learn  more about Strands Agents, you can go to the documentation using the QR code on the left. If you want to get your hands on this code in particular, the QR code on the right will take you to our nonprofits sample page on GitHub. You can see all the code, get your hands dirty with it, and extend it for whatever you want to do. Maybe you want to include cost or performance optimization as a separate agent or separate tool for helping to improve your workload over time.

I know this is the last session of the week as far as our nonprofit  track goes, but if you do not know who your AWS account team is for your organization, use the QR code on the right here to get in contact with your account team and have access to Solutions Architects like myself and Mike if you need any help building this out or just want to talk about what you do and how we can help. One last resource is the AWS Skill Builder page. If you  want to get your hands dirty with any other kind of resources that we may have talked about here today, go to Skill Builder, and there are workshops and other learning resources that are available to you for learning all about AWS. With that, thank you so very much for your time.
