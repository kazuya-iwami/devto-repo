### Introduction: Panel of SAP Customers on Their AWS Transformation Journey

 Welcome to our session today. I'm really excited to be your host. My name is Salit Khan. I've been with Amazon for about 6.5 years. I'm here with a group of esteemed colleagues from some of our select customers. They're going to introduce themselves, and the reason we have this session is to have our audiences learn from the experiences of our customers and their transformational journey with their SAP workloads on AWS. As a quick introduction, I'm going to have our esteemed panel introduce themselves. We'll start with Pete.

[![Thumbnail 30](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/4c5037b32fa8fcb6/30.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pb_-CaVe6Q&t=30)

 We'll go to Purna and then Simon. Pete, over to you. Thanks all. My name is Pete Rauchenstein. I am a cloud engineer and SAP basis platform specialist at Mondelez International. If you're not familiar with Mondelez, we are one of the largest consumer products companies, making wonderful, delicious treats like Oreos, Cadbury, and many other fun goodies. We're really excited to be here.

Thanks, Pete. I love all those goodies too, by the way. Hi, I'm Purnachand Aravapalli. I work with Colgate Palmolive as a director for infrastructure and database architecture. Colgate Palmolive is a global consumer company with a $20 billion turnover. Thanks, Purna. Simon, over to you. My name is Simon Davies. I am the general manager for what's known as core banking at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. For those of you who aren't familiar, Commonwealth Bank, or CBA, is the largest bank in Australia. We bank about one in three people in Australia, just to give you an indication.

### Commonwealth Bank of Australia: Choosing AWS for Mission-Critical Core Banking at Scale

That's amazing. So for the first part of this section, I'm going to ask our colleagues here what caused them to choose AWS for their SAP transformational journey. A couple of questions and just a couple of housekeeping items. We're not going to have any Q&A at the end of the session, but if you have any questions, we invite you to join us at Smith and Wollensky tomorrow. If you have any questions on where to go and where to sign up, I've got two of our marketing colleagues right in the front. You can come ask them to make sure you register and you can access both our customers and folks that are from SAP and AWS.

All right, so for our first question, Simon, you just introduced yourself from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a company that processes 40% of Australia's transactions. This is a transaction workload that is really risk averse. Can you talk to us about what made you select AWS in your transformational journey, please? Yes, so as you said, 40% of transactions in the economy. CBA is Australia's biggest bank. Almost one in two times money changes hands in the economy, it goes through our SAP system. You know, when you buy lunch, buy your groceries, send money to people, there's a good chance it goes through this system.

Not only is this CBA's most critical system, but in a real sense, this underpins the entire economy. So it was a big decision for us to make. Just by way of a frame of reference, core banking transformations in general, SAP or not, about 70% of them fail, and you often end up seeing CIOs or CEOs move on as a result. So it was quite a big obligation. We chose AWS, I think, for probably three reasons, and the first is really about scale and resilience. I think AWS was a good cultural fit for us. They shared our value of customer obsession and they deeply understood the level of obligation that a workload of this magnitude had. They had the experience in running other very large SAP workloads to give us that trust that this would be a safe place for us to run.

I think the second reason is really in the engineering partnership. Running a workload of this scale is a little bit different from your traditional ERP. This is very high throughput online transaction processing with really tight NFRs, low latency online workload. We knew that we would need to engineer our way out of a lot of problems, and certainly we discovered quite a few things that aren't in the standard SAP architectures that we needed to work through. We did things with AWS to solve some of those problems, and there was a new feature introduced into EC2 as a result, which I'm really proud of because all SAP customers can leverage it from here. That partnership, having AWS with us every step of the way to tackle those really hard problems, was really important.

And then I think the last one is that when we thought about this migration, it wasn't really just a case of lift and shifting the technology. Certainly we had the same 2027 end of service that I think a lot of us were staring down the barrel of, which was the original impetus, but it was also an opportunity.

It was an opportunity for us to be really honest about ourselves and about the state of our technology stack, which we had lived with for about a decade and a half. We came from mainframe and mid-range systems that were rock solid, but characteristically rocks are not known for their flexibility or agility, and that was certainly true of our operations.

We had eight different teams that ran the stack from top to bottom. They all spoke different and obscure languages, which made it really difficult to coordinate between them or get anything done. Moving to S/4 on AWS gave us the opportunity to look at this from a full stack perspective, but not just with that workload in isolation. We could land it in an ecosystem that was constantly evolving and innovating itself.

This allowed us to take advantage of the best that AWS has to offer and more seamlessly integrate with the rest of our workloads, whether our digital channels or the work we are doing in the Agentic and AI space. AWS was a good partner for us, not just to run this safely, but to run it in bold new ways.

### Mondelez International: Building a Consistent Operating Model Through Cloud Engineering

The audience should understand that if you are going through your selection process looking for a partner, cultural fit is really important. Leadership principles matter, but having an innovation partner where you can work backwards from your customer needs, like co-development of EC2 health monitor health checks, is really important as well. Experience and scale are critical factors. If you are thinking about moving your SAP workloads or considering RISE, that is a workload that you really want to be active and functioning at all times.

Everyone has a different starting point to their journey. Mondelez is a company that has only been around for about sixteen years. It is really a combination of the Kraft North America business and the Cadbury business in Europe and other parts of the world. As a result, many of our core systems have different approaches that have grown over time, and the challenge is how to go from having some systems on legacy on-premises data centers to having other systems where we did a number of migrations to the cloud earlier on a different hyperscaler.

I started that journey in 2017, a little bit before my time, but it was clear that running things differently was not really going to scale as we wanted to continue our journey. About four years ago, some of my colleagues and I who are all here in the audience joined Mondelez to really stand up an internal cloud engineering organization. A lot of what was discussed really resonates about having a consistent operating model. One of the things that we are really proud of is that everything that we have done in AWS, with the exception of the vending of the very first root account, has all been done using infrastructure as code and the account factory for Terraform.

We have had a wonderful partnership from day one with AWS Professional Services. We have set up this really awesome plumbing where we can go from requirement to realization in many cases in less than a few hours. My boss actually deployed some servers from his son's soccer game from his phone with some of the tooling that we have built. However, a lot of that focus was on the non-SAP stacks.

We have started recently our journey to S/4 HANA. If this were just a straight upgrade process, it would probably be a much less difficult journey. However, because we are addressing some of the foundational issues of the past of having different systems that were built by different teams over different times in different hyperscalers with different operating systems and different versions, there is a lot of foundational harmonization work that is happening at the same time that we are also going to ask for on RISE, which means new ways of working for the entire organization. We have a very experienced basis and platform team that works with us, and it is somewhere in the neighborhood of four hundred twenty-five years of combined experience.

So we're very particular about how things are done. Shifting to run those workloads in a new hyperscaler with a new way of working added a little bit of risk. For us, it was really important to build on the wonderful relationship that we started developing with AWS in 2021 to de-risk this and make it easier for the organization.

Having a trusted partner like AWS to help us navigate has been invaluable. We needed to ensure we set everything up correctly from an infrastructure perspective and that our landing zone looked correct. We also had to have capacity reservation conversations, and some of our colleagues here have helped us in many ways, helping us meet our own SLAs for delivering that infrastructure. Building on that trusted partnership and having people that know us has been really awesome.

### Colgate Palmolive: Performance Benchmarking and Cloud Diversification Strategy for RISE

That's great, Pete. Thank you so much. I love the comment you made earlier that resonates with me: everyone has a different starting line, but it's the journey that really matters. Speaking of the journey, I'd love to have Perna share your journey. I caught up with you a little bit earlier and learned that you made the decision to come to AWS re:Invent just last year. I'd love to learn more about that, Perna.

Again, the good points mentioned by Simon and Peter—we have different perspectives and different journeys. From Colgate, we're a 250-year-old company serving across about 200 countries and territories. Our mission is reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets, and the planet. It's a strong statement from Colgate. Companies surviving for 250 years have been going through great transformations.

We started our Rise journey, and currently we have six production landscapes running on Rise on the AWS platform. We are going to migrate another eight systems by mid-2027, including our most critical transactional systems. Everything is going well with our plans. When we started, we brainstormed internally and decided on the things we wanted to go with. The first thing is performance—we always say the same or better.

We are rock solid on-premises, running systems like IBM, but transformation is important. We decided to go with performance and a roadmap aligned with SAP. When we looked at performance, we did benchmarking across comparable workloads. We saw that AWS met our expectations and delivered the desirable performance. That gave us confidence to go at scale and run large systems.

The roadmap that SAP has aligned with AWS also gave us confidence. Additionally, we want to diversify—cloud diversification is important to our company's strategy. All together, these factors gave us the path to do this. We migrated our systems to S/4HANA in 2019. We always work very closely with our partners—we don't call them vendors; we call them partners.

When we started with SAP in 2019, our business case was only to go to cloud. We had our business case covered in the transformation. It was not easy because you can show the benefits with S/4HANA transformation and cloud together, but for us, the challenge was that we already had a transformation for five years. How do you do that? That's where those three principles and the same or better clearly helped us. We are running six systems so far.

That's awesome, Perna. Thanks for sharing that. I'm jealous too. That's pretty amazing that you guys started in the cloud and moved into transformation. That was really good. Amazon has a lot of programs to offer to SAP customers and to all enterprise customers, whether in the areas of assessments, building business cases, helping you accelerate your migration journey with our partners, or directly with our services teams.

### Leveraging AWS Programs: Professional Services, Partner Relationships, and Infrastructure as Code

The next couple of questions are really to get lessons learned. Did you use some of the programs? Did you get good experiences? What could you share with our audience from your transformation journey? I'll start with Pete. Pete, I'd love to learn about what kind of programs worked for you and any lessons learned you'd like to share with the crowd.

I think the biggest success for us has been our relationship with AWS Professional Services. They have been with us from day one, working with our core engineering team, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. We still have weekly office hours four years in where we're learning about the latest techniques and have a chance to ask questions and work on things together. One of our colleagues who has been with us from day one is still here with us today at AWS re:Invent, so having that kind of deep personal relationship has been really wonderful.

I would also say that using forums like this to meet other leaders in the space has been invaluable. We have a relationship with an SI partner, Lemongrass, who we met here at re:Invent four years ago. The question was who's the best at taking SAP to the cloud, and we knew that was going to be a thing for us soon. Building that relationship and finding people that think about systems engineering and automation the same way that we do has been essential. Everything that we want to be able to do is about scale, doing things in a repeatable way, leveraging Infrastructure as Code principles where we can, and automating the mundane so that we can focus on those truly transformational, value-added activities.

Getting a chance to meet partners like that here at re:Invent has been wonderful, and of course, having access to a broad array of subject matter experts who can take a look under the hood at some of the things we've done in RISE, offer suggestions, and find things that may or may not be issues later has been invaluable. It's always good to walk into things eyes wide open.

### Lessons Learned: Performance Improvements, Resilience Engineering, and Enablement Support

I would probably look at this through three lenses. The first one is performance improvements. This was certainly a system of record for us, our most critical system of record, but increasingly we wanted to turn it into a system of intelligence. We wanted to do more things with deep personalization and behavioral banking, and that requires significant computational power. Moving away from our legacy DB2 on mainframe R3 stack to S4 on AWS, we got about a 30 percent improvement for both online web service traffic and batch workloads.

This improvement manifests most readily in things like balance updates happening much faster than they used to. Previously, someone would make a payment and then they'd have to refresh the screen to see their balance update. Now that happens straight away. It also enables more inline processing, such as fraud checks that can happen in real time. For batch workloads, the improvement allows us to do things like increasingly offer customer-based pricing, which requires millions and millions of recalculations every day to determine the best price for a given customer segment. We got quite a bit more headroom with this move that allows us to do more in those batch windows.

Resilience is the second lens, and we touched on that a little bit in terms of the operating model. One of the other things I'm really proud of with this move was our recovery time objective. Previously, if we were to do a site swap, our RTO was about an hour and a half. We used to rehearse this every year, and it would be a bit of a manufactured exercise. Everyone would get at their keyboards, get warmed up, they got their coffee, they got their run sheet, start your engines, and in that manner we could choreograph the entire thing and execute it in about 30 minutes. That's pretty good, but it's a bit artificial.

When we moved to S4, out of the box we were seeing about a 16-minute failover when we did HANA. Still pretty good, but in a very downtime-sensitive environment in banking, we wanted to optimize that a little bit more. We did some deep engineering with SAP, with Red Hat, and with AWS, and we actually pushed in a whole bunch of improvements at both the Red Hat kernel level and to Pacemaker.

And as I said, an enhancement to EC2 with the skip shutdown feature that was released. It's awesome to see some of the work that we've done to push the boundaries make its way back into the main code line for these software vendors and for AWS. We can see that all customers in the future will be able to benefit from some of this innovation, which is awesome.

The last thing I'd call out here is efficiency. Firstly, infrastructure efficiency. We came from very expensive specialized compute, which isn't going to be true for everyone, but the move to commodity x86 saw a 30% reduction in just infrastructure costs, which is significant. Beyond that, I like Pete's journey because we had a very similar approach. It was automate everything top to bottom, and that's not just provisioning, but our operations as well.

This includes things like scale out, restart, failover, start, stop, cluster moves, all of this kind of stuff. What that did was take out hundreds of manual touch points per month and move us to just executing these automated pipelines. Our focus is now less about keeping the lights on, and we get to focus more on building what's next. One of the things we talked about this morning was a real focus on AI ops, how do we build a system that detects anomalies and learns and takes action. That's what I'm really excited about.

I've heard you mention resiliency a couple of times, and I love the perspective that it's not only being resilient within your environment but also in your operations and your daily activities that can be automated as well. Purnachand, you mentioned you've got a number of environments running in the cloud. Can you touch on which programs worked well for you and the lessons learned in moving that journey into AWS?

We started this AWS journey mainly specific to SAP Rise early in the first quarter of this year. Within almost eight months, we migrated six production landscapes, which is pretty significant. We have a strong cloud team that understands cloud technologies well, but AWS was something new to us. For us, enablement was key because we had very limited time to get into this. Considering the criticality of SAP applications, the focus was to get that support and ensure we had everything needed for the Rise migrations.

It's like crawl, walk, and run. We started with those things using the immersion days and AWS Well-Architected Framework with help from our account team. Initially, the main key was connectivity. For users to connect with our existing infrastructure to AWS, it was critical for performance. We worked closely with AWS. They flew out for an on-premises workshop with multiple discussions about connectivity patterns. They suggested different options, and finally we could deploy the interconnect very fast and run it very well, which helped us in the performance area.

The support from the AWS account team was very good. They've been helping us throughout. Even with SAP Rise, we have regular calls with the AWS team, and they discuss requirements and understand what's coming new with us. They had a couple of sessions mainly on the security side. We are working on building our AWS security posture, which really helped us.

Immersion days and Well-Architected reviews are service offerings that anybody in our audience can choose to leverage. These are offered at no cost and they're complimentary. My team leads them, your account teams can lead them, and we can bring in our innovation roadmap to go through where it makes sense to deliver your business outcomes. We were doing the proof of concept before deciding. When our team was working with AWS, they were so comfortable they could talk in the customer language. Sometimes it's hard to get this because every enterprise has their own requirements. We saw that the AWS team could understand the requirements and help us with what was needed and ensure that even the testing was successful.

Working backwards from customer requirements is key. In fact, one of the biggest announcements we made this year was our AI co-innovation program with SAP where we work with our customers and partners to build out their agenda capability, leveraging SAP's full stack and AWS's full stack.

### Modernization and Innovation: AI, Agentic Banking, and Accelerating Time to Value

On the topic of modernization and innovation, I'd love to hear from our panel your perspective on what it means to modernize. Simon, if you don't mind starting off with you. Core banking innovation is pretty significant and close to your heart. We'd love to learn about what's happening next in the modernization journey for core banking with respect to Commonwealth Bank of Australia and really the economy in Australia.

I think it's a journey, and even getting here, we definitely learned a lot. AI is certainly being a thing. We experimented deeply with how we use this for building more robust automated test cases as well as increasing engineering productivity for a lot of the code remediation that we need to do with the move. The state of the art for the tools changes so rapidly. We started off with Amazon Q and we had mixed success. We've also experimented with tools like Rudin Klein or GitHub Copilot. We've got some clunky workflows at the moment. A lot of these plugins don't exist for Eclipse, so we end up with a situation where developers are using VS Code and then copying and pasting from VS Code into Eclipse to push changes. From a developer experience perspective, you get a little bit of pushback, but the people who are really keen get really excited and can live with that. That can only get better.

Beyond the actual implementation and change on the system itself, this system is not just our biggest system of record. It's about 90 percent of all of our customer and account and transactional data at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. You really need to think about it as the richest source of customer behavioral insights that we have in the bank. We often hear it said that data is the fuel for AI. There is no higher octane fuel than what we have here. Really being able to exploit that is important.

Historically, there was high friction with getting access to that data. It was a combination of a lockdown ecosystem and some performance constraints on being able to push data out en masse. With the move that we've made here, we can actually invent everything that comes out of this system in real time. Real live signals are coming out of this system at up to about 5,000 transactions per second. This means we can get that customer data to our data scientists and to other engineering teams who are building new agentic solutions a lot faster than we were ever able to before.

Straight out of Hana to Amazon MSK, we can push it through Kinesis to SageMaker, and increasingly we're doing things with Bedrock and Agent Core. As we imagine what the next decade of agentic banking might mean, we're experimenting with Bedrock and Agent Core and what capabilities that will give us to deliver more hyper-personalized behavioral banking experiences and intelligent experiences to our customers. We think the potential is huge. This one move that we've made to something so critical to Commonwealth Bank of Australia has just been foundational. I think it's going to unlock the next decade for us.

That's excellent. I can feel the passion, and it's a really exciting space. Simon, I'm going to follow up with you as well. We recently announced full support for ABP and Amazon Q Dev, including the Eclipse plugin. We have a lot more planned. If anyone's interested, we actually have a developer workshop, which we call a chalk talk, where you can actually go hands-on with Amazon Q Dev and start building out some of those workflows yourself. I highly encourage our audience to try that out. I love hearing about the modernization capability that you have available.

We also have a lot planned around strands and agentic capabilities within Bedrock to help you manage those agents as well. So everybody who's listening in, please keep a close eye on that space. We'll have a few announcements coming out soon. Purnachand, I'd love to hear your perspective on modernization and what services you're leveraging at Colgate Palmolive.

For us, SAP and AWS is like SAP Rise core platform because SAP systems are generally the key, the central thing where you get the data and the data goes into the systems. What we are doing currently is that our journey has just started, so currently we are using complementary AWS services for the RC platform.

One example is that for SAP systems to run, we need storage or compute for the systems. To connect NetApps and printing all of the services, we are trying to use those services. They are helping us with a kind of transformation, slowly getting into the cloud, while the other components are running on-premises in parallel.

We are also doing data collection from systems running in different locations, both on-premises and in different places. We are collecting data related to network, storage, and how much data is getting transferred through egress or ingress, as well as latency. We have applications, so we are evaluating which components should be closer together and what can be moved. I think that will give us the clarity to move systems into AWS in our own accounts.

Including AI as well, it would give us the ability to leverage AWS AI capabilities. One more thing to mention is that we have our branding websites for multiple brands that already run on AWS. They are helping us with global reach, stronger performance, and even for brand advocacy. We started with RISE, but we know that it is not easy to avoid AWS. AWS touches everything, so that is where we can say our business is happy with those things.

Not only do we run our enterprise workloads, but our company's website and marketing platforms all consume AWS services. Everything infrastructure is code, a nice machine from GitHub. We use a tool called Spacelift for all Terraform automation and software deployment, and then creating those different accounts in AWS. A lot of what we have dipped our toe into recently has been with Amazon Q. Maybe because we are not writing ABAP in that yet, we have not had some of the fun things that Simon found, but I am very interested in the workshop that was mentioned.

A lot of developer efficiencies are coming from that. As someone who does not get to write a lot of Terraform these days, a little less than I used to, but when I am struggling with some sort of complex map object or what is the most efficient way to build this, something that I spent literally eight hours at re:Invent a couple of years ago working on, I did a similar thing in about ten minutes with Amazon Q. That was kind of fun, finding the right prompt to ask the question instead of having to ask my colleague Zach, who is in the audience.

I think that is one thing that is really important. Other things that we are doing with our journey to RISE is that not every one of our SAP workloads is going to land in RISE. We have some specific workloads that SAP has said probably makes sense for us to host ourselves. It has been a lot of fun working with our partner Lemongrass on really revamping the way that we are delivering workloads in the cloud. They have their own infrastructure and SAP initial deployment automated solution that allows you to go from basically a well-defined JSON document to a working installed vanilla SAP system in a couple of hours.

From infrastructure provisioning to all of your user accounts set up at the OS level and all of your database users, it is very repeatable and highly scalable. It allows our teams on the functional side to start working sooner. It is about accelerating time to value in a way that is consistent, repeatable, and easy to execute. We find a lot of value in that because we are able to take a lot of the tooling that we have already built out for some of our non-SAP applications and apply those same techniques and principles. It is a little different, but it is more the same than it is not.

I think that is kind of cool, and then I think the last one is that it has been really fun to watch SAP's journey as they talk about Clean Core and all of the work on the Business Technology Platform. I know they do all of their initial development in AWS.

So it's been fun to see not only the new capabilities that they are delivering, but also to see that they have a Terraform provider. We can find new ways to do the same things and take those same infrastructure code principles. Instead of needing a new BTP sub account and asking someone to do this manually from a click ops perspective, we take those existing pipelines that we've written. That's great. A great example for some of you who've been familiar with the new business data cloud product, BDC, one of the tools in there is DataSphere. We did a POC earlier this year on DataSphere. We were on a call with the SAP team and they said, "Well, we need a new sub account. Can you vend this for us? It'll probably take you about a week." I asked a few questions and by the end of the meeting, I had already vended your account. Here it is. It's ready to go.

Finding ways to accelerate the easy stuff is important. You have to go slow at the beginning to go fast later, but we're having a lot of fun moving fast now. SAP does build first on AWS for a lot of reasons. SAP is a first class citizen for AWS workloads. We've got a robust roadmap of innovation and joint innovation for those in the audience. Anytime we launch a region, we ensure that those systems that support SAP workloads, Rise and Native, are accessible and available at launch date.

### Key Advice for Transformation: Evidence-Led Decisions, Partnership, and Change Management

We're going to move on to wrapping up this customer panel. I'd like to ask each of our guests on stage for a personal lesson in the journey for both transforming your business to consume and work with SAP and AWS, but also in the organization. From all that you've learned and experienced, what would you advise our audience to take home with them? I'll start with you, Steve.

I would say the biggest thing for me is that I've always been in roles where I've had to be the subject matter expert. I think learning that all of us, it's a team sport. It's an open book test. You have help with everybody and it's pass fail. Whether you're the one that answers the question or whether you are bringing as many of your friends, colleagues, and partners to the game as possible, that's okay. Being able to be a little bit more humble in terms of not having to be the one that knows everything is important. Not everyone knows everything, but there are lots of people out there who are willing, able, and incentivized to help you on your journey. They want to see you be successful.

Finding the right partners, whether it's with AWS or your different systems integrators who can help you on that journey, that's probably the most important thing. I think the other thing is just don't be afraid. We're doing a lot of things that people have told us you can't do or you can't make that work. Having fun challenging the status quo, just because we've always done it that way doesn't mean we can't find better ways to do things. I think having a little bit of courage and trusting that if you build a good team with the right partners and the right technical expertise, you can do a lot of really cool things.

I'll iterate what Pete mentioned in the beginning. It's an open book test team. There is a pass fail, but fail fast. There are plenty of opportunities and safe spaces that we offer for you to explore, invent, simplify, and learn from that development journey. Failure is not an option, so don't be afraid. Definitely take that first step. There's a lot of options for you to co-develop with AWS and co-develop with your partners to find a better path. I love the comment that someone came to you on this one saying, "Oh no, you can't do that." We hear that a lot from customers that are exploring SAP workloads. I would tell you there's a lot of opportunity to break glass and co-innovate with both SAP and AWS in your journey for your transformation.

Specifically, I would like to highlight a few points on the Rise JD. As we have been discussing, our systems are running fine. We want to transform. How do we prove it? The first thing I learned is that you should let the evidence lead. Because there are different opinions, like this system performed better or that one performed better, the benchmarking, POC testing, and other things cut through the opinions. What we have is right. So it helped us to make the decision.

Initially, when we started, it was difficult, but having the numbers made it easier. The data is key—that is one of the learnings. The other thing I would say is that you should always work with your partners or vendors. It is very critical because they are your transformation enablers. We have been working with SAP as one of our key partners, so we follow them. That is where we started our S4 journey at the beginning. Even though we are doing RICE, we want to align with their roadmap because they are also one of the key enablers. Technology is key for success, so always ensure that you are aligned in different areas and work with them closely with trust.

Giving feedback is important, and appreciating feedback is equally important. That is what we do always. Work with them closely and always ask what is in it for me. Tell them what customer needs are, and also tell others what they will gain with this solution so they can take the learnings. The other thing is that SAP is a platform, so use additional transformation capabilities to make them enablers for business growth. You can use AI capabilities or other components, but you can start with a certain point and begin enabling with other components. We are still trying to get into some of the AWS components, so I could not talk much about it, but there are some interesting technologies available.

Change management is key when you are doing transformation. It touches everyone from business to IT, so we are putting huge focus on change management and communicating to the teams. Sometimes they ask what RICE is or whether it is just going to the cloud, what they need to test, and what they need to do. We are using change management to address these concerns. Whenever something new comes up, because it is a long journey, be ready to adopt those changes and be open to them. Capture the learnings from every migration and apply them to the next one. This is very important because we have seen new issues and strange issues, and capturing and applying them is critical.

Link every initiative with the business case because you start these large projects with a business case. Always be clear on what you are doing with specific scope. If anything changes, ensure you determine whether it is within the business case or outside of it. Prepare for cutover on day two operations. There is nothing wrong with that. In my experience with migrations, if you are prepared, it is good. If nothing happens, it is fine, but if something happens, you are prepared for it. Our CIO and other people ask if we are prepared for everything, which means everything. If it goes well or does not go well, we do not want business to be impacted by IT. That is our job.

### Culture and Courage: Bias for Action and Running Amber to the Finish Line

Have evidence lead the way, partner with everyone to help you find the right journey, and prepare for go-live cutover and day two operations. I agree with all those lessons. They completely resonated with our experience. I definitely like the hold my beer approach because you hear so much about standard architecture, reference architecture, and certified solutions, but the reality is that simplicity is earned. You have to find the solution that fits for you. Change management is really important. When you are doing something like this, it is equal parts about transforming the culture as it is about transformation for mission-critical systems.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia is quite a big place. I think a lot of us work at very large organizations. Ours is about 50,000 people. It is a huge distributed organization with different priorities and different silos that people work in, which is a tough thing to navigate at times.

It's easy to fall into what I call the waiting place—a term Doctor Seuss actually coined. You're waiting for someone to respond, waiting for somebody to do the work they promised, or waiting for the right conditions. At Commonwealth Bank of Australia, we have three core values: care, commitment, and courage. When you look at our recognition portal, which I'm sure many companies have, you see loads of recognitions around care and commitment because those are easy things to identify. However, it's more difficult to identify what courage means. For me, courage is taking action and moving forward.

We did an off-site at the AWS office early on with about 100 to 120 people in the room, and I think this was pivotal to transforming our culture. We sat everyone down, talked about what our vision means not just to the organization but to all the people involved and their careers, especially since many have worked in this space for quite a long time. We did an exercise where we picked some of the Amazon leadership principles that I thought were particularly relevant, and the one I really liked was bias for action. Everyone shared what they thought bias for action looked like, and to me, that's courage.

This reminds me of a quote from Kevin Smith, the director of Clerks, Chasing Amy, and Mallrats. He talked about how he succeeded in Hollywood against the odds with really low budget productions initially. He said the secret was to have a reasonable amount of unreasonableness, and I really like that because I think it's true of any hard thing, and certainly it's true of transformations at this scale. When I reflect on our journey, we basically ran amber the entire time. Everyone said there's no way we'd hit the date, we'd run behind, there's so much schedule compression and external dependencies.

Running amber led to a bit of a mantra of mine: amber is a racing color. I was watching a lot of Formula One during this program, and for those familiar with Formula One, McLaren won the constructor's championships. They're orange, papaya, or amber, really, but it became a signal or shorthand. Amber is focused and determined and consistent under pressure, and that's how we behaved as a team. If we'd gone red, I'd be telling a story about Ferrari, but I think amber is probably the best place to be.

Culture is pivotal to this. It's about being a little bit unreasonable, having courage, and always moving forward. This isn't just about technology; it's really a people business. The care, commitment, and courage principles that the company founded and we live by, combined with the project running at amber with urgency, helped us reach the finish line and create a transformational experience for all banking customers in Australia. It also lifted the standard of our whole bank because it redefined what's possible and what excellence looks like.

For audience members, this is not a short journey; it's a transformational journey that you'll partner with both your cloud provider, AWS, SAP, and your systems integrators to reach your final state. That final state is also evolving, with each of the panelists discussing how they're modernizing, automating, and leveraging AWS best services to help innovate and create new experiences for their customers. I'm honored to be here to hear everyone's journey. Thank you to each of you for sharing your perspectives and to our audience for listening in. We'll wrap it up, and if you have any questions, come by tomorrow at Smith and Wollensky, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you again.
