### Introducing Rovo Dev: Atlassian's AI-Powered Teammate for the Software Development Lifecycle

 I'm Jovana, Senior Technical Evangelist at Atlassian. I specialize in platform engineering and cloud infrastructure, as well as Rovo Dev and everything related to improving the software development lifecycle. Let's get into it.

[![Thumbnail 20](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/20.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=20)

Before we dive in, let's quickly set the stage.  Why are developer productivity and quality so critical? My favorite explanation is that if you invest in your developers, they will have better support, creating a better product. If you have a better product, your company brings in revenue. It's as simple as that.

[![Thumbnail 40](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/40.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=40)

At Atlassian,  we now run the Developer Experience report, and each year we learn something new. From our 2025 DevEx report, we've learned that 99 percent—so almost every developer—has reported time savings using AI. However, developers are still losing time across the software development lifecycle. They're only spending 16 percent of their time coding, which we all know is not the friction point for developers. The other 84 percent is where AI tools and assistants have the real market opportunity to change and improve things.

[![Thumbnail 90](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/90.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=90)

[![Thumbnail 120](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/120.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=120)

Developers are losing valuable time on non-coding tasks, and that's exactly what I want to talk to you about today.  Software development is at its core a team effort, and our vision at Atlassian is for every software development team to have a teammate that deeply understands their organizational context as it's captured in the Atlassian Ecosystem—from Jira issues through Confluence pages, all the way through the codebases, wherever those codebases live. That teammate should be aware of your engineering history,  including past incidents and their resolutions.

[![Thumbnail 140](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/140.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=140)

Now, that intelligent teammate can put all that knowledge to work for you, assisting you wherever you are working, whether that's a terminal, the IDE, the CI/CD pipelines, or maybe even Jira.  That teammate can be Rovo Dev, and I would like to introduce you to it. Rovo Dev is Atlassian's AI-powered agent for developers. It is designed to accelerate the software development lifecycle all the way through code planning, code generation, code reviews, and automation of repetitive tasks at scale. It understands both natural language and code, which means you can interact with it wherever you're working. It is powered by Atlassian's Teamwork Graph, which means it has context of all of your data within the Atlassian Ecosystem.

[![Thumbnail 180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=180)

 Of all the places that you can interact with Rovo Dev, my favorite one is the CLI because it's meeting me where I like to work. It leverages Teamwork Graph, so I can ensure that it has all the right suggestions for me, it has all my real context, and it knows my business. Let's take a look at it in action.

[![Thumbnail 210](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/210.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=210)

[![Thumbnail 220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/220.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=220)

[![Thumbnail 230](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/230.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=230)

[![Thumbnail 240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/240.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=240)

Here is a website  that I created one time, and we have these speakers that are all wrong. Yes, that is me, Jovana, Senior Technical Evangelist, but that was not my face.  What I can do is ask Rovo Dev to fix this for me. Right now, I've just authenticated Rovo Dev, I've gone to my Jira issue,  and I've literally just copied that issue link and pasted it into Rovo Dev. Rovo Dev is pulling all that information— the description, any other links that I might have added to this issue—just so it can give me the best response it can.

[![Thumbnail 250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=250)

[![Thumbnail 260](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/260.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=260)

[![Thumbnail 270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=270)

[![Thumbnail 280](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/280.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=280)

[![Thumbnail 290](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/290.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=290)

Now, it might be leveraging memory files as well, depending on what I had added in that description of the ticket.  If I go back and refresh, it's updated,  and now all of us kind of look the way we should be looking. That is Shane, that is Willer, and that was me. Now, one of the cool things is I can just copy an image,  paste it into Rovo Dev and let Rovo Dev read the image as is,  detecting what is on the image so that it can make those changes. It is intelligent enough that it will recognize that there are certain things on that image that are not supposed to be there,  and it goes on and fixes it. I'm quickly swapping between the two just so you see that it's actually updated exactly what I highlighted that I need changing.

[![Thumbnail 300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=300)

### Rovo Dev's Comprehensive Features: From Code Reviewer to Pipeline Troubleshooting Across Your Entire Toolchain

Next, we've introduced an AI-based code reviewer that is also part of Rovo Dev. 

[![Thumbnail 340](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/340.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=340)

On repositories where Rovo Dev is enabled, Code Reviewer will automatically run after your pull request is created. Code Reviewer spends a few minutes analyzing the code changes and then it comments directly onto your pull request with all the possible recommendations, fixes and improvements that should be made. It makes comments including feedback on bugs, maintainability, readability, security, and so on. 

There are ways to improve your code reviewer and tailor it to your specific organizational needs. Firstly, acceptance criteria is designed to bridge the gap between your requirements and your code. Acceptance criteria checks automatically and compares the code in your pull request to the requirements you had in your Jira issue. It's checking if you built exactly what you said you would. You can catch mistakes early with this feature, and we've actually been told by software teams that it has saved them a lot of time.

[![Thumbnail 430](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/430.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=430)

Secondly, we have custom instructions that you can set up for your repos. You can teach Code Reviewer exactly what matters to your organization, to your team, to your codebase. Every team has unique ways of working and different standards that they want to enforce, and sometimes generic code just doesn't cut it. If you teach Code Reviewer certain standards and design principles and you feed that to Rovo Dev, every time your pull request is created, Rovo Dev will detect based on these standards that you are violating those principles. It is described in your standard natural language, so just write in English, plain English. As long as you commit that into your repo, you should be good to go. 

[![Thumbnail 450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/450.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=450)

Now, we've also launched Rovo Dev in Jira. It is very soon coming to open beta. Temporarily it's in closed beta, but it is a self-contained AI-driven workflow that helps you tackle work items with efficiency. Let's have a look at a demo. 

[![Thumbnail 460](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/460.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=460)

[![Thumbnail 470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/470.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=470)

[![Thumbnail 480](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/480.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=480)

[![Thumbnail 490](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/490.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=490)

What this means is you'll be able to trigger Rovo Dev directly from your Jira issue, and even do that at once for a number of your Jira tickets from the backlog.  What it does is it opens up an interactive sandbox that looks and feels like VS Code directly within your Jira issue.  Everything happens autonomously, which means Rovo Dev will work on your issue, it will create a pull request, and it will let you know when there is something for you to review.  It will also update the status of that Jira ticket if you're the owner. 

[![Thumbnail 510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=510)

[![Thumbnail 520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/520.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=520)

[![Thumbnail 540](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/540.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=540)

The benefits of this is that at any point in time, you can also go back and look at all the sessions that you've triggered with Rovo Dev within Jira. Only you have access to this sandbox because it feeds off of your credentials, so security is in place. Now, what actually happens is this opens up a chat with Rovo Dev.  If you're not happy with what you see, the changes that it made, you can go back and give it some feedback. I do encourage you to give it feedback if you're not happy with what it's done.  Ask it to make more changes. Once you are ready with everything that it's produced, you can go and create a pull request, and this is the stuff that I told you about, having access to all of your sessions at all times. 

[![Thumbnail 550](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/550.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=550)

[![Thumbnail 570](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/570.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=570)

[![Thumbnail 580](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/580.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=580)

[![Thumbnail 590](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/590.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=590)

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=600)

[![Thumbnail 610](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/610.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=610)

We've also brought Rovo Dev extension into VS Code. Let's get to the video immediately and then I can walk you through what it actually does.  Connecting your Atlassian cloud side will instantly pull all your Jira tickets that you are assigned to, whether it's in to-do, in progress, or in review.  You can start working on a Jira issue directly from VS Code.   What it does is it will open up Rovo Chat and you can just tell it what kind of stuff you want it to do, attaching the Jira issue to it.  It will also send you notifications if anyone has made changes to the Jira tickets  that you are following or working on.

[![Thumbnail 620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=620)

[![Thumbnail 630](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/630.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=630)

So if you are working from VS Code with Rovo Dev,  you will be getting notifications at all times. Very similar to Rovo Dev in Jira and Rovo Dev in CLI, you can talk to Rovo Dev from VS Code.  We are working on adding that to JetBrains, so stay tuned.

[![Thumbnail 650](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/650.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=650)

[![Thumbnail 670](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/670.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=670)

[![Thumbnail 690](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/690.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=690)

Productivity for software teams is increased through automation in Rovo Dev's Code Reviewer. Automation rules may be created  to review pull requests or generate code. With Rovo Dev in automations,  you can enforce organizational code quality standards across teams and repos. Imagine all those code standards that you want to enforce—now you can apply them to more than just one codebase. You can apply them to all of your workspaces. You can also delegate repetitive tasks at scale,  letting your team focus on important work.

[![Thumbnail 700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/700.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=700)

[![Thumbnail 710](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/710.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=710)

[![Thumbnail 720](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=720)

[![Thumbnail 730](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/730.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=730)

Once you set up your coding, security, privacy, or design standards, you can use Rovo Dev to automatically review  every pull request against those standards. You can also enter custom instructions for Rovo Dev to use when reviewing your pull request,  like I have done here. Similarly, you can define common coding patterns and use Rovo Dev to automatically generate code  for repetitive tasks. It lives in Jira in multiple ways, and you can automate pretty much anything.  I am literally demoing the stuff that I have asked it to do—identify all the logging non-compliance standards that we do not allow—and it has actually done it and told me about the violation.

[![Thumbnail 750](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/750.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=750)

[![Thumbnail 760](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/760.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=760)

[![Thumbnail 770](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/770.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=770)

[![Thumbnail 780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/780.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=780)

[![Thumbnail 790](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/9f2611becf3c9c83/790.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdb_8qR41i8&t=790)

We have also launched Rovo Dev in pipelines  in Bitbucket Cloud as part of Rovo Dev. It diagnoses and resolves CI/CD pipeline failures  and analyzes those failed builds through steps and provides root causes, suggesting actionable fixes.  The more you use Rovo Dev in pipelines, the better it gets because it will learn about your failed builds each time.  So instead of manually digging through your logs, the troubleshooter surfaces that context for you directly in Bitbucket Cloud. 

How does Rovo Dev actually stand out from all the other AI coding assistants? Apart from being an AI coding assistant, it helps with all the other eighty-four percent of software development lifecycle tasks that I know no one really wants to do. Rovo Dev uniquely connects to Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket, but also GitHub, providing context-aware insights across your entire toolchain, leveraging the Teamwork Graph that connects your Atlassian Ecosystem data. Secondly, it is AI-powered automation across the software development lifecycle. Unlike tools that focus only on code, Rovo Dev does much more.

Thirdly, it is a terminal-first, context-rich experience, which means it is designed to meet you wherever you are working—in the IDE, in the CLI, in Jira, and in the CI/CD pipelines. Finally, it is enterprise-grade security and customization. It lets teams customize workflows, set review standards, and tailor AI behavior. Thank you so much for listening. If you have any questions, I will be right here. I am also at the Atlassian booth, and there are many more demos I can do than just this one. Thank you all for coming, and thank you all for being patient.
