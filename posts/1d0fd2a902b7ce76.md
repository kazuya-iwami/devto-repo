### Introduction: Epic on AWS Has Become Standard Practice

 Welcome. I'm Michael Hegyi. I am in my fifth year at AWS. I like to say that I do Epic stuff at Amazon, mainly because I came out of retirement after spending about thirty years at Epic. I was Epic's technical fellow, so what does a technical fellow do? We looked at new technology for Epic's core system to make it easier to implement, easier to operate, and easier to scale.

Over the past four re:Invents, we've really focused on running Epic on AWS. We've heard from Tufts Medicine sharing their story on how they implemented Epic directly onto AWS. They were the very first organization to run production Epic on AWS. We heard from Geisinger Health in a three-part series where they talked about their decision, their execution, and the results they received migrating Epic and non-Epic applications, what we call integrated applications, onto AWS from on-premises.

[![Thumbnail 80](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/80.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=80)

 That brings us to today's bold claim. Running Epic on AWS has become standard practice, or at least it's becoming standard practice. I'd like to substantiate that claim for you in terms of adoption, benefits, and results. Then we're going to pivot to what we're going to be talking about today: going beyond the EHR.

[![Thumbnail 140](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/140.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=140)

### The Growth and Benefits of Running Epic on AWS: Adoption, Technology, and Financial Results

When I started with AWS in 2021, the Epic on AWS community contained only two health systems: Tufts Medicine, which was known as Wellforce back then, and Central East Hospital Cluster out of Ontario, Canada.  If we fast forward to today, there are forty-six organizations in the Epic on AWS community from the United States, Canada, Australia, all live or implementing Epic on AWS.

[![Thumbnail 180](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/180.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=180)

When I talked to a healthcare executive about why, he framed it very well. He said it comes down to the tight margins that health systems have to operate in. It's important to look beyond just benefits to IT. There needs to be a focus on three benefits: the business benefit, the technology benefit, and the financial benefit.  The important thing is these don't all have to be in balance like a triangle; they just have to be in harmony with each other.

If we look at the business benefit, we're talking about agility, experience, and security. From the agility standpoint, we're talking about ensuring that infrastructure isn't getting in the way of innovating for the populations that you care for. Infrastructure isn't getting in the way of speed of mergers and acquisitions or divestitures. It isn't getting in the way of leaning in with Epic's Community Connect, where you're offering Epic to health systems that you have a clinical relationship with that can't necessarily get Epic directly themselves.

On the experience side of things, we're making sure that given how much we're demanding of our physicians and nurses in terms of documentation, they get a delightful experience running Epic. From a security standpoint, health systems are getting inundated with ransomware attacks, and having an Epic isolated recovery environment running on AWS gives us confidence that we can still continue to deliver informed patient care even if ransomware has taken their on-premises systems offline.

[![Thumbnail 270](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/270.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=270)

 When we take a look at the technology side of things, it comes down to scale, resilience, and performance. When we talk about scale in Epic terms, we're talking about something called global references per second, or GREFs. That's how Epic measures how much work is being run on their database. Epic sizes their workload on AWS larger than any other cloud provider, and it's been that way since they first started sizing on AWS in 2021. It was eight million global references per second, or GREFs. In 2023, it grew to forty-two million, and today in 2025, we're at one hundred forty million.

That represents about an 80% year-over-year growth compared to a normal health system that grows on average 20% year-over-year. It's important to stay ahead of your growth from a resilience standpoint. Over that same time period, AWS has the best resilience record. It's more than just service resilience; it's also about application resilience. The Epic AWS architecture that we collaborated with Apion is spread across 2 regions and 3 availability zones in each region. That's like spreading risk across at least 6 data centers.

Then there's performance, making sure that you get consistent, excellent response times. The way you do that is first, use fast technology that Epic approves. Second, use the newest fast technology. Third, make sure that you are replacing your Epic stamps with the latest technology to ensure consistent, excellent response times. That also helps drive down some costs, keeps the response time good, and keeps your clinicians happy.

[![Thumbnail 390](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/390.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=390)

Which brings us to the financial side of things. Jeff Bezos once said that there are two types of companies.  Those that work towards price increases and those who work towards charging less. We will be the second. If we take a look at the 116 price reductions in AWS services as of July of this year, many of you probably know that, but the focus on trying to save you money is something core to our culture. We've seen organizations improve their operating margins, and we've also seen organizations take some of that savings and start investing it into innovative practices.

[![Thumbnail 440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/440.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=440)

[![Thumbnail 460](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/460.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=460)

We have those three benefits, and the results really speak for themselves. If we take a look at the KLAS research that's done with health systems,  where they survey respondents on their experience with a vendor, AWS received the highest marks. This led KLAS to award AWS with the best in class for public cloud in 2025. So what does all this mean?  This is what I used to support the claim that Epic on AWS has become a standard.

[![Thumbnail 510](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/510.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=510)

### Beyond the EHR: Two Stories of Transformation

What we want to do now, we've talked about moving Epic to AWS in the past at re:Invent, but today I want to look at what are folks doing to improve their operating outcomes beyond the EHR. What are folks doing to improve their clinical outcomes beyond the EHR? What AWS services are folks using that include EHR data that really help improve care delivery? To answer those questions,  we're going to hear two stories from two organizations, two speakers, two transformations.

We are going to hear from Jupiter Medical Center and their experience with Amazon Connect, and we're going to hear from Rady Children's Health and their experience building a modern data platform. Then we're going to sit down and have a fireside chat with them as we dive a little bit deeper. Let me introduce our first speaker. This is one of the pioneers of Epic's Community Connect program, one of the first organizations to implement where they share their Epic environment with smaller health systems, and now it's pretty much standard in all Epic health systems. Today he is the Chief Information Officer of Jupiter Medical Center in Florida. Please welcome to the stage, Kevin Olson.

### Jupiter Medical Center's Journey: Unifying Patient Experience with Amazon Connect

The Godfather, grandfather of Community Connect, that's kind of nice. All right, we'll go with that for today. Thanks, Mike. I'm Kevin Olson, Chief Information Officer at Jupiter Medical Center. I've been there for about 5.5 years. For those that don't know about Jupiter Medical Center, we are in Palm Beach County, South Florida, just north of Miami and Fort Lauderdale, tucked up on the Treasure Coast of Florida, a very attractive place to live. People come there from the north during the winter to enjoy warm weather instead of cold up in the north. So we're going through that experience right now. It's a great market, and we've done some really cool things over the last couple of years, including our migration to Epic on AWS.

[![Thumbnail 620](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/620.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=620)

So a little bit about Jupiter Medical Center. We're very proud in terms of our independence.  We're the only independent healthcare system in the area. We've got tenants, we've got HCA, Cleveland Clinic, everybody's around because it's an attractive market. With that said, we're also very proud of our score in terms of Leapfrog A, CMS 5 stars, which really measure clinical outcomes, which is what we're all striving for.

But we all face these cost increases. Mike kind of referred to it a minute ago—labor costs, supply costs, everything else going up. But then our reimbursement remains relatively flat, maybe 2 to 3% in Medicare, but then the private payers follow suit and they're kind of in that same ballpark. So it's a very challenging time in terms of margins in healthcare, and there's no real light in sight in terms of this big pot of money sitting at the end of a rainbow. So we've all got to roll up our sleeves and figure out how to run more efficiently and effectively.

For us, our journey was really to get away from this fragmented system we had. We're very proud of our outcomes in terms of clinical care, but the systems and platforms that we're utilizing and running did not reflect that. So we had very fragmented experiences for our providers and for our patients. If you had a clinical visit in the hospital, you'd have to go to one portal. If you had a clinical visit in an ambulatory setting like your provider's office, you had to go to another. And if you had to pay your bill, you had to go to a third.

[![Thumbnail 720](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/720.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=720)

Our goal was really to create one unified experience for our patients and our providers. In 2022 we decided to take the journey, make the leap, and go to Epic, having gone through a few of these in the past. It was a pretty good journey for us with the overarching goal of having one experience for our patients, which was absolutely crucial because it's a differentiator in a competitive market with those costs increasing and reimbursement staying flat at best.  So that was our overarching goal—to really make that experience a meaningful one for our patients, world class as we say in our delivery of care.

That went well. We went live, but along the way we recognized there were some additive technologies and benefits that we could take advantage of, one of which was AWS Connect. So we reached out to our partner at the time and said, "Hey, we can do something different. We have this really very old legacy platform. It's costing us three-quarters of a million dollars a year. We have a 9% abandonment rate because of folks just not getting the service that they're looking for. The analytics didn't exist. We had to sift through manual reports."

At the same time, we've got these very expensive diagnostic imaging modalities—CT, MRI—that are really not being utilized to their fullest. We're at about 75% utilization as far as our imaging modalities, and patients are frustrated. They may get an appointment two weeks out instead of in 24 to 36 hours. So those are a couple of big deals. And again, the cost of running such a platform was a little bit extravagant in terms of cost. So we had every intention of making a change there. We reached out to our rep and we decided to put that in the scope of our Epic migration.

[![Thumbnail 820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/820.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=820)

Fast forward to 2024, Labor Day of 2024, we went live and we saw that radiology backlog really decrease.  We saw a 60% reduction in utilization of schedules and capacity utilization of those very expensive modalities—CT, MRI. We saw a 20% improvement, which is significant, so much so that we've got another CT that we'll be installing here in the next probably 3 months, I believe is the target date. Our abandonment rate in terms of calls reduced by 50%. We're at about 4% now, and then again, the operating expense significantly reduced as well. So really, really good positive outcome.

[![Thumbnail 870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=870)

So the next piece of this is where do we go next? As we continue our journey in terms of patient engagement, patient satisfaction, and creating that world-class experience, there are other additive benefits that we found along the way.  Mike mentioned IRE. We've got the marketplace to buy underlying technology, but really think about what is next in terms of AI enablement and experience enablement for the patient. We're really looking at some at-home functions where I'm at home, I need to get to a clinic, what's the closest one? What's the best one? How do I get there fast? What's the directions? Can I integrate that with MyChart somehow to kind of do the navigation and get information into the portal? So that's something that we're looking heavily at currently as we speak.

There's a lot of other things outside of the patient experience space in terms of technology, but that is a huge one for us that we're looking at because of the competitive landscape. It's not getting any less competitive. UHS has a hospital they're building. I can almost see it from my office, not quite. It's a little bit of an exaggeration, but it's close. And so it's getting tighter and tighter, and we want to remain independent and keep our independence intact because we're emphatic about keeping it intact and profitable. So that's a big deal for us.

[![Thumbnail 940](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/940.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=940)

So patient experience and clinical outcomes are one and two, if you will. So more to come as things develop.  One key takeaway as we look at the technology and underlying technology, and we hear this in the press and everywhere, is that AI is going to displace folks. However, healthcare is a very human experience, right? Taking care of our bodies takes a lot to traverse the system. It's difficult talking to insurance companies, going from one care setting to another, whether it's off-site, off-campus, or onto a main campus. It's difficult. So our intention is really to make that as seamless as humanly possible for every patient that we serve in our community.

### Rady Children's Health: Building a Digital Nervous System with Platform Mosaic

With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike. I'm looking forward to have a seat over here. Thanks. I look forward to diving a little deeper in the fire chat. I'd like to introduce our second speaker. She was a literal rock star in a previous iteration of her career. Rockstar meaning Rockstar Games, you know, Grand Theft Auto. She has taken her experience and brought that into healthcare now, and she's the Director, Integration and Analytics at Rady Children's Health, Caroline Peika. Thank you so much. Let's do it.

[![Thumbnail 1030](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/1030.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=1030)

I started at Rady Children's Health two years ago, and the first question I asked was,  where's the data? And the answer I got was everywhere. Some data was hosted by third parties like CERN or our legacy data platform. Some data was on SQL servers that were managed by IT in some basement room. We all know those rooms. And most of the data was in dashboards, emails, laptops, and people's minds. Our data was like a thousand puzzle pieces spread across different tables, every piece being beautiful on its own, but we didn't have the full picture of a child's healthcare at any point.

Every click, every email, every login, every data extract cost us time. And in pediatrics, seconds matter. When a clinician has to wait for data to load, the patient has to wait for their care to move forward, and that's what we are fixing. So we started building the digital nervous system at Rady Children's Health. It's a living, learning ecosystem where data flows freely and securely from bedside to boardroom to the research lab, where insights are available as fast as our patients grow. That's the transformation we started.

[![Thumbnail 1130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/1130.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=1130)

The first thing we built was our new data platform, Platform Mosaic.  It's a cloud-native platform built on AWS and powered by Databricks, Tableau Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise. It's governed, it's scalable, and it's ready for AI. Databricks is the engine beneath the hood. That's where our data experts prepare, transform, and model data at scale within one single workspace, so everybody's collaborating. It's also the space where we have our Ask the Data functionalities. That's when a non-technical person can ask questions in plain English and explore a data set. Imagine that. It's democratizing data science responsibly and securely.

Tableau Cloud is our facet of our Mosaic platform. It's where clinicians, analysts, and operational leaders can access visual stories and these dashboards instead of having outdated extracts. They have access to fresh data.

This is also where they can all collaborate, share, develop new dashboards, and publish them within the guardrails of our data governance. Elation is our brain trust. That's where we document all our KPIs, catalog all our data, and where tribal knowledge is finally available and certified. There's also the functionality to ask in plain English questions like where can I find asthma cases by zip code and get an answer in plain English, where you get the data steward, the data set, and the business KPIs that you are probably going to be wanting.

Finally, we have AWS, and AWS has all these tools: Athena, Glue, and SageMaker. It's the playground for our research and innovation. Our researchers are able to experiment, analyze, and develop models at scale. All of this is collaborative with cross-functional teams and other institutions, but at the same time they can do this within hours and minutes rather than waiting for infrastructure to happen with IT.

This data platform is where governance meets empowerment. All these tools enable creators to innovate, researchers to develop faster, and users to have access to insights faster. But our journey to the cloud is not just about technology; it's about partnership. AWS was our partner in moving from a concept to reality. They actually co-invested in our modernization efforts, making us innovate faster. We had an AWS architect within our sprints who was helping us develop our architecture, making sure that we could always track the cost of whatever we were going to build and building an infrastructure and architecture that was really secure and HIPAA compliant.

[![Thumbnail 1370](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/1370.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=1370)

AWS helped us design this environment that's HIPAA compliant and secure, making sure we can encrypt everything, have role-based access, and ensure that everything was embedded. When our data engineers had to create new pipelines, this took hours instead of months.  Then there's our RCH chat. It's our private generative AI assistant that we've built in the same AWS ecosystem. It's on Claude 3.5 and has RAG models, which are retrieval augmented models. They don't guess the answer. They actually go within our internal knowledge base and get the information from our policies, operational documents, and so on.

When somebody asks what's the reimbursement policy for education, the RCH chat gets the answer from the appropriate approved policy. Or when somebody asks what are the social media do's and don'ts, it retrieves and references back to the security and compliance policy. It saves people time. They can leverage this chat with sensitive information and feel secure that the data stays in our ecosystem. There are no hallucinations, and every private chat is logged and HIPAA compliant. I got some feedback where somebody said it's like having somebody available 24/7 to help me, and that doesn't judge me with all my silly questions. That's the kind of adoption we can only dream about.

[![Thumbnail 1450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/1450.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=1450)

 So now we're in front of the next wave. We have the merger between Children's Hospital of San Diego, which hired me two years ago, and Rady Children's Health. And because we like to do this to each other, we're going to Epic. Within this merger, it's an opportunity to really reimagine everything. We'll be able to ask ourselves what applications truly serve patient care, what applications need to evolve, and what applications should go to the cloud. We want to be cloud smart. We don't want to be cloud everything. AWS taught us that infrastructure is strategy, so we want to make sure we place things where they're the best, whether it's being secure or cost.

So we'll use that lens as we take both systems from both organizations and create this connected ecosystem as we merge. Then Epic, with its native interoperability and fast data updates, is the perfect anchor for our platform Mosaic AI and advanced analytics capabilities. This is where our data strategy merges with the clinical strategy.

So what would the future look like? Imagine a researcher wanting to develop an early stage diagnostic model for congenital diseases who goes to our platform Mosaic. The data is curated and ready to go. There are amazing tools for them to build the model, and they build something within minutes, maybe hours. What about the clinicians that need to know the readmission rates in these clinics for the last three months? They go to the RCH chat, ask us questions, and within seconds they have a trusted answer. Finally, imagine the supply chain manager that gets proactive alerts when stock is low and can then make timely decisions. That's what we're doing. That's the digital nervous system we have built.

[![Thumbnail 1610](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/1d0fd2a902b7ce76/1610.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmFGxEosHc&t=1610)

So what's next? There are five facets. The first one is application modernization, which is looking at everything that we have as organizations and making sure we're making  the correct choices with regards to cloud fitness and applications in general. The second one is our data fabric. We want to make sure that what we've built for CHOC is going to integrate with what we have at Rady Children's Health and create this world of data science and AI. There's sustainability. We want to make sure we optimize our costs, our operations, our storage, everything that has to do with the cloud. There's AI enablement, so we want to add some RAG models and agentic opportunities to our RCH chat. And then finally there's community. We've started to build this vibrant data community where people learn and grow together, and that's really important for us to continue building it and making sure it thrives.

I know it's a lot. The merger, the cloud, change is scary, but for us at Rady Children's Health we've decided to go above and beyond our fear, because fear is just curiosity in disguise. It's the feeling that you get just before you learn something amazing. So we decided to try, to fail fast, and to learn faster. We built with our partners and we built with trust. Our journey was not about technology at the end. It was about courage, the courage to move from comfort to clarity and to believe that empathy and innovation can go hand in hand.

Because every time we push a byte in the cloud or we publish a dashboard or we create a chat prompt in our RCH chat, what we're really doing is getting better care faster to the children, and that's what technology should do. It should amplify care. The future at Rady Children's Health, thanks to our partners, our colleagues, and our team members, is now here. Thank you, Michael. Thank you both for your presentations. I'm looking forward to diving a little deeper with you.

### Fireside Chat: Competitive Pressures, AI Implementation, and Governance Strategies

How does the immediate competitive pressures really shape your technology decisions? Kevin, I'll start with you. I love that metaphor that you shared about being able to see that construction happening. You know, Carolyn kind of alluded to in her presentation about change. I think some folks are locked tight and don't want to change, and I think you've got to look around and look at the landscape of the competition. What do they have in terms of patient experience? I've talked about the patient experience a little bit today, and what do they have? Try to investigate how you make it better. I just think it's crucial. You know, San Diego is competitive as well, but South Florida where I'm at is very competitive, so keeping those creative juices flowing and ready to embrace  technology that can make positive change for the organization is crucial.

We'll keep doing that as we move forward.

Carolyn, staying on the theme of transformation, you've led some significant change in Children's Health with more to come. What skills and organizational changes were crucial to execute this transformation, and how did you build and develop your team? I think the number one was communication and collaboration. From my experience arriving in healthcare and definitely in my organization, there was a lot of silos. There was a lot of siloed work being done by my team or other teams, but also a lot of surprises like unexpected new initiatives.

What we really focused on was getting our stakeholders, whether physicians or revenue cycle people, involved with us from the start of the project. At first, they had no idea what platform Mosaic was or why they should care, but we brought them along with the correct messaging. We didn't want to make them completely confused, but we really brought them along the journey at every single step, including the steps where they needed to be more involved. At the end of the day, it was about teaching our team members to be more collaborative because they should be serving our stakeholders and really understanding their business as much as possible. I call it the buddy system, so we buddied up.

Both of you mentioned the human element of this, which I like to think is a transformation or transition into what I call augmented intelligence as opposed to just artificial intelligence. Kevin, you emphasized using AI to augment rather than replace human interaction. Can you give us some specific examples? Certainly, the Connect piece is not to displace a human, but to add efficiency to their everyday work. At the same time, we have data to make changes in terms of interactions with a patient and capturing information, whether it's sentiment analysis that may not be as positive as we would like. We can do that in closer to real time. That's an enabler, not just a displacer of people. It's enabling more human efficiencies.

Supply chain is another area we'll be looking heavily at. We have Workday, but we want to look at other things in terms of operational choices when it comes to supply chain replenishment. Behind labor, supplies represent the largest expense in any healthcare organization. Reimbursement is only about two to three percent, and it's not getting any tougher or any easier. I think the enablement of processes through AI is crucial, and the successful organizations are going to embrace it and not take a fear-based stance going forward.

I've heard it characterized as expanding human capacity with the folks that you do have. Carolyn, with RCH Chat, you're building a similar human-centric approach. With all the concerns around AI hallucinations and accuracy, how did you gain clinician trust in the system, and what guardrails did you put in place? We did quite a few things. The first thing is relating RCH Chat to their previous experiences with any chatbot they might have. We try to tell them it's the same as ChatGPT or any other chat you might be using, where there needs to be a human in the loop. You need to be looking at this critically. It's not different.

For those who have no experience with any chatbots, it was all about onboarding them. We really took the time to hold their hands through sessions of what this can and cannot do. Unfortunately, you can't think about all the use cases they could be using this for, but we did it in a way that was really creative and fun so they could start thinking about how they would use this in a way that makes sense. They can be critical about it.

Like any type of RAG models, we definitely did a lot of validation and we have performance monitoring on our models to make sure that they don't drift. We're very invested in that. But for the chatbot itself, it's all about education and making sure they understand it's not 100% accurate.

Let's move from technology to some of the tangible impacts that you're seeing. Kevin, you mentioned some remarkable results with Amazon Connect, including the 50% reduction in abandoned calls. What surprised you most about the operational impact within the first 30 days?

The level of adoption was a surprise. I had some concern about change management with the team, but they embraced it. They took hold of it and owned it. I failed to mention in my presentation that we have a growth strategy. We have a new patient tower, a new surgical institute that just opened up, and a new hospital we're building. Those incremental pieces are huge. If you can set aside the worry of those operational initiatives and tasks, the embracement of the technology in terms of process change for the team was a welcome surprise in a really strong way.

Carolyn, you're democratizing access with data. How do you balance making data accessible to non-technical users with ensuring HIPAA compliance and proper governance?

Step one was governance. We don't give access to anybody at any stage if we don't really understand what they have access to and what they can do with it. This is a step-wise exercise where we identify groups of people who can do things and then we enable them. We started by discovering there are a lot of power users within the organization who were new to SQL and Tableau, doing this either on their own in a silo or in their previous organizations. So we built governance for these power users on what data they can access and what tools they need. We built policies, we built a community, and we built best practices they have to follow. Definitely as they publish, we built governance of the quality. They can't publish a dashboard for broad use without coming to our team and going through the process we would go through as we were publishing our own data products.

For anybody else, whether it's with Elation or GitHub, it's all about education and use cases and building that relationship so they come to us when they have new use cases or they actually tell other people to come to us because they have use cases. We really want to make sure that people who want to do things feel welcomed to come and see my team instead of the traditional IT approach. I don't think that's really beneficial for any organization.

### Looking Ahead: Innovation Roadmaps and Future Data Integration

As we look to the future, what's next on your innovation roadmap? You shared a little bit of that, but I was wondering if you could dive a little deeper.

I mentioned the supply chain earlier, but regularly I get different partners reaching out. I spoke to a partner last week about some technologies they're utilizing to enhance robotics. I won't name the vendor, but it's probably in your healthcare institutions. Working with those partners to help our surgeons provide more efficient care and timely care. The sooner you're discharged, the happier the patient is. With the low morbidity rates and all those things that we're measuring on a regular basis, those are exciting things. That's one that's keen interest to our team for sure.

Carol, looking forward, how are you approaching the integration of traditional data sources with newer sources like genomics, social determinants of health, and IoT devices?

The platform Mosaic we've built is really with the vision of being modular. Things are going to change. For genomics, for instance, we need to figure out what's the best way to house the genomics data or use the genomics data.

We have that use case currently where we're evaluating our partners, evaluating capabilities, and evaluating our use cases of today as well as the future. For every new use case we think about what's the best solution out there or what's almost the best out there, and then we take a look to see whether we need to modify our data platform or use what we already have and build the guard rails for that.

It's all about trying and making sure that we have those moments with new vendors that want to showcase how great they are with genomics or images, for instance, and understanding what they do versus what other partners do and where we stand with regards to that. We built a platform that's modular and future proof. We can always build on it and change it. We're not locked in, which is important.

### Practical Advice: Just Do It and Embrace a Culture of Curiosity

Before we close, I want to ask you both for a little bit of practical advice. Kevin, I'll start with you. For those considering a similar journey to yours, what would you do differently if starting today? Well, you showed us early in the introduction about those that have moved Epic to AWS or went direct with their implementation. We were talking about this earlier, so just do it. The fear of failure in this space has been quite diminished. I probably couldn't say that five years ago, earlier in terms of adoption, but just doing it and recognizing that the additive features that are there on the platform that we've taken advantage of just in a small scale, we're just scratching the surface on what we can do.

The starting point is just do it. Just get it stood up and see what's there and jump on and go for the ride. That's kind of where my mind goes answering that question. Carolyn, what's your advice? What's the most important piece of advice you'd give healthcare technology leaders in the audience? What should they look to do Monday morning?

I think probably a culture change. I feel like there's definitely a lot of thinking about risk. Everything's risky and it just freezes everybody. Coming into healthcare, that was the first thing I observed. Everybody's like, no, we can't do this because of all of these things. I think it's a change of culture of asking why should we do this and what are the benefits, and moving from there we can address the risks. The risks shouldn't be the first thing we think about. It's what's the benefit and then you tackle the risks.

If at the end of the day all these risks make no sense, then they make no sense, but it shouldn't stop us from being creative and researching and thinking about new things. At the end of the day the world is going fast besides us and we're just looking at it pass by. At some point it's going to be a really huge change if we don't start today with changing how we look at things, look at curiosity, and try things out. For me, what I instilled in my team was a Friday figure-it-out-day kind of vibe where on Fridays you pick a topic you want to be curious about and you try it out and you have to come back to the team with your findings of what you tried out and what the outcome was.

That's a big culture change in healthcare in my opinion from being there just two years to really change from negative to positive. I think we've heard the term, especially outside the industry, of failing fast, and that's scary in healthcare because failure could affect patient lives. But I think there's this concept of one-way doors and two-way doors in your decision-making process. You definitely want to take your time on the one-way doors where you can't go back, but there are so many different two-way door opportunities out there to just try and just do it as you imagine.

We'll close on that. Folks, you may have some questions that you want to ask Caroline and Kevin. What we're going to do though is meet over on that far wall afterwards. We can take the microphones off and get ready for the next session up there. If we want to carry the conversation out in the hallway, we can. Both of you, thank you so much for sharing your insights, sharing your stories, and sharing your experience. It was wonderful to listen to. I've learned some things and hopefully you've learned a couple of things too. With that, we will adjourn and questions. We'll meet at the far side over there at the end. Please fill out the session forms on the app. Thank you.
