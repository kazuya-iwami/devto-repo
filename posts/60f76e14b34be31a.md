Then it's show time. Now let's see who Nissan is and what Nissan is doing now.         I'm Kazuma Sugimoto, and today I will share Nissan's vision of software-defined vehicles, or SDV. It's not just a new technology. It is a new way of thinking about the vehicle. We aim to create a vehicle that can evolve, adapt, and improve over time, just like a human brain evolves.

[![Thumbnail 190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/190.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=190)

 Let's begin by exploring how Nissan's SDV strategy will transform our customer experience. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is positioned as a strategic enabler for our SDV transformation and also a key area of competitiveness in the automotive industry. For example, our partnership with Wayve will bring AI-powered vehicles to customers in 2027. We are building AI agents to communicate with customers, making every journey unique.  AI helps us develop software faster. We can respond quickly to our customer needs as technology and customer expectations are always evolving. We at Nissan welcome this change and lead the way with innovation to create vehicles that are faster, smarter, safer, and more personal.

[![Thumbnail 300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/300.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=300)

Let's look at the construct of Nissan SDV 

[![Thumbnail 310](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/310.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=310)

 focusing on key business drivers and core technology enablers to create realized value and enhance our customers' digital lifestyle. We are focused on personalization through upgradability, which will also establish new recurring revenue streams for Nissan and value chain players across the entire vehicle life cycle. We are orchestrating the ecosystem by connecting vehicles and customers. Our goal is to quickly and continuously deliver unique driving experiences to all of our customers, tailored to their preferences while ensuring safety and vehicle performance.

From next, I will explain our enablers, which will be used by our regional engineers and are also open for third parties. I'm really happy to announce the name of our platform : Nissan Scalable Open Software Platform. This is the first time globally to announce the full structure of the name. What is your first impression of this name? It's too long, I think so too. However, this name represents the goal we aim to fulfill. We are building a scalable and open software platform.

It includes Nissan Scalable Open SDK for developers to create new applications and services. It includes Nissan Scalable Open Data, which provides easy access to our vehicle data for data-driven value generation while ensuring security. It includes Nissan Scalable Open OS, a flexible operating system for vehicles supporting updates and upgrades for new features. This platform helps us innovate faster and work with partners around the world.

I'll touch upon the deep dive on our platform. This is the overall structure of our Nissan Scalable Open Software Platform . Our platform covers not only the three major enablers but also vehicle systems, OTA reprogramming, user interface, Engineering Cloud, and more. Data comes from the OS and is analyzed and transformed for software development. New applications developed by SDK go back to the OS for customers . This cycle  and the cyclic speed is the most important.

[![Thumbnail 600](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/600.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=600)

Let me look again. Data comes from all vehicles, is analyzed and transformed for new values for development in SDK. That application goes back to your vehicle through OTA , this open software platform.

### AWS Collaboration: Engineering Cloud Architecture and AI-Driven Future Roadmap

Thank you Susan. As Susan mentioned, this is Nissan's software scalable open software platform. This is a very first globally first time announcement. I am Kazuo Kajimoto, Principal Solutions Architect at AWS. I would like to dive deeper into how AWS collaborated to accelerate  the realization of Nissan's scalable open software platform. AWS has collaborated with Nissan from 2023.  The SDV supports AWS, or AWS supports three main pillars. One is the tool on AWS. In Nissan, it is named Engineering Cloud. Tools on AWS provide quick deployment, fast CI/CD automation, and global scalability, and this is the base of AI Agent for Developers.

The second pillar is the target on AWS, which is the virtual ECU. Thanks to AWS Graviton, AWS Graviton can provide the real-time virtual ECU that is binary compatible with the physical ECU according to the environmental quality. In Nissan, this is their digital twin architecture. Nissan commits to provide the 3 OS layer virtualization. The 3 OS operating system consists of Autoza and real-time voice for functional safety, and the third one is Linux. Lightweight container management on Linux is very important. After that, I will touch upon this. And here is seamless linkage and those kinds of items are based on the AI Agent for Customers, that is the drivers and passengers.

[![Thumbnail 800](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/800.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=800)

[![Thumbnail 810](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/810.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=810)

The third pillar is the data-driven on AWS, which is the data platform. Data platform for safe and reliable vehicle data acquisition and data management framework, and finally, regional privacy policy compliance. Today, I mainly focus on the Engineering Cloud on  Nissan's scalable open software platform. Please look at the figure.  This is the architecture diagram of the Engineering Cloud in Nissan's scalable open software platform as Susan mentioned. The Engineering Cloud on AWS provides three big features. The first one is CI process automation, which achieved the testing time reduction to 75 percent. The second one is a workbench portal that provides global accessibility and quick deployment around one minute. The third one is lightweight container management with Podman, which provides better security, fewer resources, and seamless integration.

[![Thumbnail 870](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/870.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=870)

This field describes the architecture of the first feature, CI process automation.  CI process automation consists of two 5 lines. One is a model code software components SIL line. The second one is the integration SIL line. Thanks to HPC adoption and parallel processing by AutoScaling and Lambda,

[![Thumbnail 920](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/920.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=920)

this architecture achieves 75% execution time reduction relative to the original on-premises environment. We achieved this very fast CI/CD environment.  The second feature is the Workbench Portal. This is the architecture diagram. The Workbench Portal provides global accessibility so each region can deploy common and regional-specific environments. Nissan plans to onboard more than 5,000 developers in the future. The Workbench Portal consists of two layers: one is the container image builder, and the second one is a runner. Using this two-layer structure provides very high-speed deployment around one minute. Docker-in-Docker capability is also supported. Docker-in-Docker means each tool is represented by a container, and multiple container images are packed into one container. We named this technology Docker-in-Docker, and we simply implemented this Docker-in-Docker capability with our code builder.

[![Thumbnail 1010](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/1010.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=1010)

 The third feature is lightweight container management with Podman. Some of you may have heard about the technology of Podman. Podman is a container manager that provides very good security and fewer resources than the current conventional Docker. Nissan commits to provide this platform not only in virtual environments but also on physical infrastructure. Each region can deploy containerized applications to Nissan's scalable software platform. Podman runs across physical infrastructure, virtual infrastructure, and the Workbench. This is our digital three-layer architecture. Finally, this architecture is integrated with next-generation AI-driven vehicles. AI agents work within the vehicle. This is our concept and our collaboration with Nissan.

[![Thumbnail 1140](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/1140.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=1140)

Now let's look at the future roadmap of SDV with generative AI. As I said earlier, AI is a strategic enabler to realize our SDV vision. Our SDV roadmap is clear, and along with our in-house software development partners, we are adopting new technologies as they emerge. I will now introduce our SDV roadmap with AI in more detail.  We are adopting AI in our SDV roadmap, which delivers next-generation ProPILOT to customers in 2027. This enables door-to-door driving for customers with an AI driver. Going forward, AI ecosystem and AI-based software development will support quick software development and faster development cycles. Our roadmap prepares us for future innovation so we can meet customer needs with confidence.

Let's look at a video clip to see how AI brings ideas to life. Your vehicle is your personal escape,  now becoming smarter with AI and always tailored to you. It's getting hot. I want the windows to close and  the AC to start automatically when it gets hot. Simply speak your wishes. The onboard AI connects to the cloud  instantly for real-time analysis. Your personal cloud-based AI will custom build software to upgrade your vehicle and match your style. Wow, bring your ideas to life without limits.

[![Thumbnail 1250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazuya-iwami/devto-repo/main/posts/images/60f76e14b34be31a/1250.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrNnwQjKlM&t=1250)

Thank you for your attention.  Nissan will continuously provide your AI experience with high quality and safety. For today, this is all from my side. Thank you for joining this session.
